    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two incidents, widely different in character yet bound together by
      results, marked the night of January the twenty-third. On that night the
      blackest fog within a four years' memory fell upon certain portions of
      London, and also on that night came the first announcement of the border
      risings against the Persian government in the province of Khorasan the
      announcement that, speculated upon, even smiled at, at the time, assumed
      such significance in the light of after events.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock the news spread through the House of Commons; but at nine
      men in the inner lobbies were gossiping, not so much upon how far Russia,
      while ostensibly upholding the Shah, had pulled the strings by which the
      insurgents danced, as upon the manner in which the 'St. George's Gazette',
      the Tory evening newspaper, had seized upon the incident and shaken it in
      the faces of the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once before, Lakely&mdash;the owner and editor of the 'St.
      George's'&mdash;had stepped outside the decorous circle of tradition and
      taken a plunge into modern journalism, but to-night he essayed deeper
      waters than before, and under an almost sensational heading declared that
      in this apparently innocent border rising we had less an outcome of mere
      racial antagonism than a first faint index of a long-cherished Russian
      scheme, growing to a gradual maturity under the &ldquo;drift&rdquo; policy of the
      present British government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect produced by this pronouncement, if strong, was varied. Members
      of the Opposition saw, or thought they saw, a reflection of it in the
      smiling unconcern on the Ministerial benches; and the government had an
      uneasy sense that behind the newly kindled interest on the other side of
      the House lay some mysterious scenting of battle from afar off. But though
      these impressions ran like electricity through the atmosphere, nothing
      tangible marked their passage, and the ordinary business of the House
      proceeded until half-past eleven, when an adjournment was moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man to hurry from his place was John Chilcote, member for East
      Wark. He passed out of the House quickly, with the half-furtive quickness
      that marks a self-absorbed man; and as he passed the policeman standing
      stolidly under the arched door-way of the big court-yard he swerved a
      little, as if startled out of his thoughts. He realized his swerve almost
      before it was accomplished, and pulled himself together with nervous
      irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foggy night, constables,&rdquo; he said, with elaborate carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foggy night, sir, and thickening up west,&rdquo; responded the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; Chilcote's answer was absent. The constable's cheery voice
      jarred on him, and for the second time he was conscious of senseless
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a further glance at the man, he slipped out into the court-yard
      and turned towards the main gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate-way two cab lamps showed through the mist of shifting fog like
      the eyes of a great cat, and the familiar &ldquo;Hansom, sir?&rdquo; came to him
      indistinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused by force of custom; and, stepping forward, had almost touched
      the open door when a new impulse caused him to draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly. &ldquo;No. I'll walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cabman muttered, lashed his horse, and with a clatter of hoofs and
      harness wheeled away; while Chilcote, still with uncertain hastiness,
      crossed the road in the direction of Whitehall.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the Abbey the fog had partially lifted, and in the railed garden
      that faces the Houses of Parliament the statues were visible in a spectral
      way. But Chilcote's glance was unstable and indifferent; he skirted the
      railings heedlessly, and, crossing the road with the speed of long
      familiarity, gained Whitehall on the lefthand side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the fog had dropped, and, looking upward towards Trafalgar Square,
      it seemed that the chain of lamps extended little farther than the Horse
      Guards, and that beyond lay nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconscious of this capricious alternation between darkness and light,
      Chilcote continued his course. To a close observer the manner of his going
      had both interest and suggestion; for though he walked on, apparently
      self-engrossed, yet at every dozen steps he started at some sound or some
      touch, like a man whose nervous system is painfully overstrung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maintaining his haste, he went deliberately forward, oblivious of the fact
      that at each step the curtain of darkness about him became closer, damper,
      more tangible; that at each second the passers-by jostled each other with
      greater frequency. Then, abruptly, with a sudden realization of what had
      happened, he stood quite still. Without anticipation or preparation he had
      walked full into the thickness of the fog&mdash;a thickness so dense that,
      as by an enchanter's wand, the figures of a moment before melted, the
      street lamps were sucked up into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first feeling was a sense of panic at the sudden isolation, his second
      a thrill of nervous apprehension at the oblivion that had allowed him to
      be so entrapped. The second feeling outweighed the first. He moved
      forward, then paused again, uncertain of himself. Finally, with the
      consciousness that inaction was unbearable, he moved on once more, his
      eyes wide open, one hand thrust out as a protection and guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog had closed in behind him as heavily as in front, shutting off all
      possibility of retreat; all about him in the darkness was a confusion of
      voices&mdash;cheerful, dubious, alarmed, or angry; now and then a sleeve
      brushed his or a hand touched him tentatively. It was a strange moment, a
      moment of possibilities, to which the crunching wheels, the oaths and
      laughter from the blocked traffic of the road-way, made a continuous
      accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping well to the left, Chilcote still beat on; there was a persistence
      in his movements that almost amounted to fear&mdash;a fear born of the
      solitude filled with innumerable sounds. For a space he groped about him
      without result, then his fingers touched the cold surface of a shuttered
      shop-front, and a thrill of reassurance passed through him. With renewed
      haste, and clinging to his landmark as a blind man might, he started
      forward with fresh impetus.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a dozen paces he moved rapidly and unevenly, then the natural result
      occurred. He collided with a man coming in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock was abrupt. Both men swore simultaneously, then both laughed.
      The whole thing was casual, but Chilcote was in that state of mind when
      even the commonplace becomes abnormal. The other man's exclamation, the
      other man's laugh, struck on his nerves; coming out of the darkness, they
      sounded like a repetition of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine out of every ten men in London, given the same social position and
      the same education, might reasonably be expected to express annoyance or
      amusement in the same manner, possibly in the same tone of voice; and
      Chilcote remembered this almost at the moment of his nervous jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beastly fog!&rdquo; he said, aloud. &ldquo;I'm trying to find Grosvenor Square, but
      the chances seem rather small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed again, and again the laugh upset Chilcote. He wondered
      uncomfortably if he was becoming a prey to illusions. But the stranger
      spoke before the question had solved itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid they are small,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would be almost hard to find
      one's way to the devil on a night like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote made a murmur of amusement and drew back against the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We can see now where the blind man scores in the matter of
      salvation. This is almost a repetition of the fog of six years ago. Were
      you out in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a habit of his to jump from one sentence to another, a habit that
      had grown of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The stranger had also groped his way to the shopfront. &ldquo;No, I was
      out of England six years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were lucky.&rdquo; Chilcote turned up the collar of his coat. &ldquo;It was an
      atrocious fog, as black as this, but more universal. I remember it well.
      It was the night Lexington made his great sugar speech. Some of us were
      found on Lambeth Bridge at three in the morning, having left the House at
      twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote seldom indulged in reminiscences, but this conversation with an
      unseen companion was more like a soliloquy than a dialogue. He was almost
      surprised into an exclamation when the other caught up his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! The sugar speech!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Odd that I should have been looking it
      up only yesterday. What a magnificent dressing-up of a dry subject it was!
      What a career Lexington promised in those days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote changed his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are interested in the muddle down at Westminster?&rdquo; he asked,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;?&rdquo; It was the turn of the stranger to draw back a step. &ldquo;Oh, I
      read my newspaper with the other five million, that is all. I am an
      outsider.&rdquo; His voice sounded curt; the warmth that admiration had brought
      into it a moment before had frozen abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An outsider!&rdquo; Chilcote repeated. &ldquo;What an enviable word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, to those who are well inside the ring. But let us go back to
      Lexington. What a pinnacle the man reached, and what a drop he had! It has
      always seemed to me an extraordinary instance of the human leaven running
      through us all. What was the real cause of his collapse?&rdquo; he asked,
      suddenly. &ldquo;Was it drugs or drink? I have often wished to get at the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote changed his attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is truth ever worth getting at?&rdquo; he asked, irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the case of a public man&mdash;yes. He exchanges his privacy for the
      interest of the masses. If he gives the masses the details of his success,
      why not the details of his failure? But was it drink that sucked him
      under?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Chilcote's response came after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drugs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote hesitated. And at the moment of his indecision a woman
      brushed past him, laughing boisterously. The sound jarred him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it drugs?&rdquo; the stranger went on easily. &ldquo;I have always had a theory
      that it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It was morphia.&rdquo; The answer came before Chilcote had realized it.
      The woman's laugh at the stranger's quiet persistence had contrived to
      draw it from him. Instantly he had spoken he looked about him quickly,
      like one who has for a moment forgotten a necessary vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence while the stranger thought over the information just
      given him. Then he spoke again, with a new touch of vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I imagined,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Though, on my soul, I never really credited it.
      To have gained so much, and to have thrown it away for a common vice!&rdquo; He
      made an exclamation of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote gave an unsteady laugh. &ldquo;You judge hardly.&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other repeated his sound of contempt. &ldquo;Justly so. No man has the right
      to squander what another would give his soul for. It lessens the general
      respect for power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a believer in power?&rdquo; The tone was sarcastic, but the sarcasm
      sounded thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. All power is the outcome of individuality, either past or present. I
      find no sentiment for the man who plays with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quiet contempt of the tone stung Chilcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine that Lexington made no fight?&rdquo; he asked, impulsively.
      &ldquo;Can't you picture the man's struggle while the vice that had been slave
      gradually became master?&rdquo; He stopped to take breath, and in the cold pause
      that followed it seemed to him that the other made a murmur of
      incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you think of morphia as a pleasure?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Think of it,
      instead, as a tyrant&mdash;that tortures the mind if held to, and the body
      if cast off.&rdquo; Urged by the darkness and the silence of his companion, the
      rein of his speech had loosened. In that moment he was not Chilcote the
      member for East Wark, whose moods and silences were proverbial, but
      Chilcote the man whose mind craved the relief of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as the world talks&mdash;out of ignorance and
      self-righteousness,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Before you condemn Lexington you should
      put yourself in his place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you do?&rdquo; the other laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsuspecting and inoffensive as the laugh was, it startled Chilcote. With
      a sudden alarm he pulled himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;?&rdquo; He tried to echo the laugh, but the attempt fell flat. &ldquo;Oh, I
      merely speak from&mdash;from De Quincey. But I believe this fog is
      shifting&mdash;I really believe it is shifting. Can you oblige me with a
      light? I had almost forgotten that a man may still smoke though he has
      been deprived of sight.&rdquo; He spoke fast and disjointedly. He was
      overwhelmed by the idea that he had let himself go, and possessed by the
      wish to obliterate the consequences. As he talked he fumbled; for his
      cigarette-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bead was bent as he searched for it nervously. Without looking up, he
      was conscious that the cloud of fog that held him prisoner was lifting,
      rolling away, closing back again, preparatory to final disappearance.
      Having found the case, he put a cigarette between his lips and raised his
      hand at the moment that the stranger drew a match across his box.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second each stared blankly at the other's face, suddenly made
      visible by the lifting of the fog. The match in the stranger's hand burned
      down till it scorched his fingers, and, feeling the pain, he laughed and
      let it drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all odd things!&rdquo; he said. Then he broke off. The circumstance was too
      novel for ordinary remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one of those rare occurrences, those chances that seem too wild for
      real life and yet belong to no other sphere, the two faces so strangely
      hidden and strangely revealed were identical, feature for feature. It
      seemed to each man that he looked not at the face of another, but at his
      own face reflected in a flawless looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two, the stranger was the first to regain self-possession. Seeing
      Chilcote's bewilderment, he came to his rescue with brusque tactfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The position is decidedly odd,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But after all, why should we be
      so surprised? Nature can't be eternally original; she must dry up
      sometimes, and when she gets a good model why shouldn't she use it twice?&rdquo;
       He drew back, surveying Chilcote whimsically. &ldquo;But, pardon me, you are
      still waiting for that light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote still held the cigarette between his lips. The paper had become
      dry, and he moistened it as he leaned towards his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mind me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm rather&mdash;rather unstrung to-night, and
      this thing gave me a jar. To be candid, my imagination took head in the
      fog, and I got to fancy I was talking to myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pulled up to find the fancy in some way real?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Something like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both were silent for a moment. Chilcote pulled hard at his cigarette,
      then, remembering his obligations, he turned quickly to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you smoke?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger accepted a cigarette from the case held out to him; and as he
      did so the extraordinary likeness to himself struck Chilcote with added
      force. Involuntarily he put out his hand and touched the other's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my nerves!&rdquo; he said, in explanation. &ldquo;They make me want to feel that
      you are substantial. Nerves play such beastly tricks!&rdquo; He laughed
      awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other glanced up. His expression on the moment was slightly surprised,
      slightly contemptuous, but he changed it instantly to conventional
      interest. &ldquo;I am afraid I am not an authority on nerves,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote was preoccupied. His thoughts had turned into another
      channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other did not answer immediately. &ldquo;My age?&rdquo; he said at last, slowly.
      &ldquo;Oh, I believe I shall be thirty-six to-morrow&mdash;to be quite
      accurate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote lifted his head quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you use that tone?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I am six months older than you, and
      I only wish it was six years. Six years nearer oblivion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again a slight incredulous contempt crossed the other's eyes. &ldquo;Oblivion?&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Where are your ambitions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't exist? Yet you voice your country? I concluded that much in the
      fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When one has voiced one's country for six years one gets hoarse&mdash;it's
      a natural consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled. &ldquo;Ah, discontent!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The modern canker. But we
      must both be getting under way. Good-night! Shall we shake hands&mdash;to
      prove that we are genuinely material?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote had been standing unusually still, following the stranger's words&mdash;caught
      by his self-reliance and impressed by his personality. Now, as he ceased
      to speak, he moved quickly forward, impelled by a nervous curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we just hail each other and pass&mdash;like the proverbial
      ships?&rdquo; he said, impulsively. &ldquo;If Nature was careless enough to let the
      reproduction meet the original, she must abide the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed, but his laugh was short. &ldquo;Oh, I don't know. Our roads
      lie differently. You would get nothing out of me, and I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
      and again laughed shortly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'd be content to pass, if I
      were you. The unsuccessful man is seldom a profitable study. Shall we say
      good-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Chilcote's hand for an instant; then, crossing the footpath, he
      passed into the road-way towards the Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done in a moment; but with his going a sense of loss fell upon
      Chilcote. He stood for a space, newly conscious of unfamiliar faces and
      unfamiliar voices in the stream of passersby; then, suddenly mastered by
      an impulse, he wheeled rapidly and darted after the tall, lean figure so
      ridiculously like his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way across Trafalgar Square he overtook the stranger. He had paused
      on one of the small stone islands that break the current of traffic, and
      was waiting for an opportunity to cross the street. In the glare of light
      from the lamp above his head, Chilcote saw for the first time that, under
      a remarkable neatness of appearance, his clothes were well worn&mdash;almost
      shabby. The discovery struck him with something stronger than surprise.
      The idea of poverty seemed incongruous is connection with the reliance,
      the reserve, the personality of the man. With a certain embarrassed haste
      he stepped forward and touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, as the other turned quietly. &ldquo;I have followed you to
      exchange cards. It can't injure either of us, and I&mdash;I have a wish to
      know my other self.&rdquo; He laughed nervously as he drew out his card-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger watched him in silence. There was the same faint contempt,
      but also there was a reluctant interest in his glance, as it passed from
      the fingers fumbling with the case to the pale face with the square jaw,
      straight mouth, and level eyebrows drawn low over the gray eyes. When at
      last the card was held out to him he took it without remark and slipped it
      into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote looked at him eagerly. &ldquo;Now the exchange?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second the stranger did not respond. Then, almost unexpectedly, he
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, if it amuses you&mdash;&rdquo; he said; and, searching in his
      waistcoat pocket, he drew out the required card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will leave you quite unenlightened,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The name of a failure
      never spells anything.&rdquo; With another smile, partly amused, partly
      ironical, he stepped from the little island and disappeared into the
      throng of traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote stood for an instant gazing at the point where he had vanished;
      then, turning to the lamp, he lifted the card and read the name it bore:
      &ldquo;Mr. John Loder, 13 Clifford's Inn.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morning following the night of fog Chilcote woke at nine. He woke
      at the moment that his man Allsopp tiptoed across the room and laid the
      salver with his early cup of tea on the table beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several seconds he lay with his eyes shut; the effort of opening them
      on a fresh day&mdash;the intimate certainty of what he would see on
      opening them&mdash;seemed to weight his lids. The heavy, half-closed
      curtains; the blinds severely drawn; the great room with its splendid
      furniture, its sober coloring, its scent of damp London winter; above all,
      Allsopp, silent, respectful, and respectable&mdash;were things to dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full minute passed while he still feigned sleep. He heard Allsopp stir
      discreetly, then the inevitable information broke the silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine o'clock, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes, murmured something, and closed them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man moved to the window, quietly pulled back the curtains and half
      drew the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better night, sir, I hope?&rdquo; he ventured, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote had drawn the bedclothes over his face to screen himself from the
      daylight, murky though it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Those beastly nightmares didn't trouble me, for
      once.&rdquo; He shivered a little as at some recollection. &ldquo;But don't talk&mdash;don't
      remind me of them. I hate a man who has no originality.&rdquo; He spoke sharply.
      At times he showed an almost childish irritation over trivial things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allsopp took the remark in silence. Crossing the wide room, he began to
      lay out his master's clothes. The action affected Chilcote to fresh
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm sick of that routine: I can see you laying
      out my winding-sheet the day of my burial. Leave those things. Come back
      in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allsopp allowed himself one glance at his master's figure huddled in the
      great bed; then, laying aside the coat he was holding, he moved to the
      door. With his: fingers on the handle he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you breakfast in your own room, sir&mdash;or down-stairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote drew the clothes more tightly round his shoulders. &ldquo;Oh, anywhere&mdash;nowhere!&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;I don't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allsopp softly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, Chilcote sat up in bed and lifted the salver to his
      knees. The sudden movement jarred him physically; he drew a handkerchief
      from under the pillow and wiped his forehead; then he held his hand to the
      light and studied it. The hand looked sallow and unsteady. With a nervous
      gesture he thrust the salver back upon the table and slid out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving hastily across the room, he stopped before one of the tall
      wardrobes and swung the door open; then after a furtive glance around the
      room he thrust his hand into the recesses of a shelf and fumbled there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing he sought was evidently not hard to find, for almost at once he
      withdrew his hand and moved from the wardrobe to a table beside the
      fireplace, carrying a small glass tube filled with tabloids.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table were a decanter, a siphon, and a water-jug. Mixing some
      whiskey, he uncorked the tube, again he glanced apprehensively towards the
      door, then with a very nervous hand dropped two tabloids into the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they dissolved he stood with his hand on the table and his eyes
      fixed on the floor, evidently restraining his impatience. Instantly they
      had disappeared he seized the glass and drained it at a draught, replaced
      the bottle in the wardrobe, and, shivering slightly in the raw air,
      slipped back into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Allsopp returned he was sitting up, a cigarette between his lips, the
      teacup standing empty on the salver. The nervous irritability had gone
      from his manner. He no longer moved jerkily, his eyes looked brighter, his
      pale skin more healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Allsopp,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are some moments in life, after all. It
      isn't all blank wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ordered breakfast in the small morning-room, sir,&rdquo; said Allsopp,
      without a change of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote breakfasted at ten. His appetite, always fickle, was particularly
      uncertain in the early hours. He helped himself to some fish, but sent
      away his plate untouched; then, having drunk two cups of tea, he pushed
      back his chair, lighted a fresh cigarette, and shook out the morning's
      newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice he shook it out and twice turned it, but the reluctance to fix his
      mind upon it made him dally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the morphia tabloids was still apparent in the greater
      steadiness of his hand and eye, the regained quiet of his
      susceptibilities, but the respite was temporary and lethargic. The early
      days&mdash;the days of six years ago, when these tabloids meant an even
      sweep of thought, lucidity of brain, a balance of judgment in thought and
      effort&mdash;were days of the past. As he had said of Lexington and his
      vice, the slave had become master.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he folded the paper in a last attempt at interest, the door opened and
      his secretary came a step or two into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, sir!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Forgive me for being so untimely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a fresh-mannered, bright-eyed boy of twenty-three. His breezy
      alertness, his deference, as to a man who had attained what he aspired to,
      amused and depressed Chilcote by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Blessington. What is it now?&rdquo; He sighed through habit, and,
      putting up his hand, warded off a ray of sun that had forced itself
      through the misty atmosphere as if by mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy smiled. &ldquo;It's that business of the Wark timber contract, sir,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;You promised you'd look into it to-day; you know you've shelved it
      for a week already, and Craig, Burnage are rather clamoring for an
      answer.&rdquo; He moved forward and laid the papers he was carrying on the table
      beside Chilcote. &ldquo;I'm sorry to be such a nuisance,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I hope your
      nerves aren't worrying you to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote was toying with the papers. At the word nerves he glanced up
      suspiciously. But Blessington's ingenuous face satisfied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I settled my nerves last night with&mdash;with a bromide.
      I knew that fog would upset me unless I took precautions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad of that, sir&mdash;though I'd avoid bromides. Bad habit to set
      up. But this Wark business&mdash;I'd like to get it under way, if you have
      no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote passed his fingers over the papers. &ldquo;Were you out in that fog
      last night, Blessington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I supped with some people at the Savoy, and we just missed it.
      It was very partial, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington put his hand to his neat tie and pulled it. He was extremely
      polite, but he had an inordinate sense of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but about that contract&mdash;I know I'm a
      frightful bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the contract!&rdquo; Chilcote looked about him absently. &ldquo;By-the-way, did
      you see anything of my wife yesterday? What did she do last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Chilcote gave me tea yesterday afternoon. She told me she was dining
      at Lady Sabinet's, and looking in at one or two places later.&rdquo; He eyed his
      papers in Chilcote's listless hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote smiled satirically. &ldquo;Eve is very true to society,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      couldn't dine at the Sabinets' if it was to make me premier. They have a
      butler who is an institution&mdash;a sort of heirloom in the family. He is
      fat, and breathes audibly. Last time I lunched there he haunted me for a
      whole night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington laughed gayly. &ldquo;Mrs. Chilcote doesn't see ghosts, sir,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;but if I may suggest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote tapped his fingers on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Eve doesn't see ghosts. We rather miss sympathy there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington governed his impatience. He stood still for some seconds, then
      glanced down at his pointed boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be lenient to my persistency, sir, I would like to remind you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote lifted his head with a flash of irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, Blessington!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Am I never to be left in peace?
      Am I never to sit down to a meal without having work thrust upon me? Work&mdash;work&mdash;perpetually
      work? I have heard no other word in the last six years. I declare there
      are times&rdquo;&mdash;he rose suddenly from his seat and turned to the window&mdash;&ldquo;there
      are times when I feel that for sixpence I'd chuck it all&mdash;the whole
      beastly round&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Startled by his vehemence, Blessington wheeled towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your political career, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment in which Chilcote hesitated, a moment in which the
      desire that had filled his mind for months rose to his lips and hung
      there; then the question, the incredulity in Blessington's face, chilled
      it and it fell back into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't say that,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;You young men jump to
      conclusions, Blessington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, sir. I never meant to imply retirement. Why, Rickshaw, Vale,
      Cressham, and the whole Wark crowd would be about your ears like flies if
      such a thing were even breathed&mdash;now more than ever, since these
      Persian rumors. By-the-way, is there anything real in this border
      business? The 'St. George's' came out rather strong last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote had moved back to the table. His face was pale from his outburst
      and his fingers toyed restlessly with the open newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen the 'St. George's',&rdquo; he said, hastily. &ldquo;Lakely is always
      ready to shake the red rag where Russia is concerned; whether we are to
      enter the arena is another matter. But what about Craig, Burnage? I think
      you mentioned something of a contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't worry about that, sir.&rdquo; Blessington had caught the twitching at
      the corners of Chilcote's mouth, the nervous sharpness of his voice. &ldquo;I
      can put Craig, Burnage off. If they have an answer by Thursday it will be
      time enough.&rdquo; He began to collect his papers, but Chilcote stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, veering suddenly. &ldquo;Wait. I'll see to it now. I'll feel
      more myself when I've done something. I'll come with you to the study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked hastily across the room; then, with his hand on the door, he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go first, Blessington,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll&mdash;I'll follow you in ten
      minutes. I must glance through the newspapers first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington looked uncertain. &ldquo;You won't forget, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget? Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still doubtfully, Blessington left the room and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once alone, Chilcote walked slowly back to the table, drew up his chair,
      and sat down with his eyes on the white cloth, the paper lying unheeded
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed. A servant came into the room to remove the breakfast.
      Chilcote moved slightly when necessary, but otherwise retained his
      attitude. The servant, having finished his task, replenished the fire and
      left the room. Chilcote still sat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, feeling numbed, he rose and crossed to the fireplace. The clock
      on the mantel-piece stared him in the face. He looked at it, started
      slightly, then drew out his watch. Watch and clock corresponded. Each
      marked twelve o'clock. With a nervous motion he leaned forward and pressed
      the electric bell long and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly a servant answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Blessington in the study?&rdquo; Chilcote asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was there, sir, five minutes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote looked relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Tell him I have gone out&mdash;had to go out. Something
      important. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before the words had been properly spoken Chilcote had passed the man
      and walked into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leaving his house, Chilcote walked forward quickly and aimlessly. With the
      sting of the outer air the recollection of last night's adventure came
      back upon him. Since the hour of his waking it had hung about with vague
      persistence, but now in the clear light of day it seemed to stand out with
      a fuller peculiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was preposterous, nevertheless it was genuine. He was wearing
      the overcoat he had worn, the night before, and, acting on impulse, he
      thrust his hand into the pocket and drew out the stranger's card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. John Loder!&rdquo; He read the name over as he walked along, and it
      mechanically repeated itself in his brain&mdash;falling into measure with
      his steps. Who was John Loder? What was he? The questions tantalized him
      till his pace unconsciously increased. The thought that two men so
      absurdly alike could inhabit the same, city and remain unknown to each
      other faced him as a problem: it tangled with his personal worries and
      aggravated them. There seemed to be almost a danger in such an
      extraordinary likeness. He began to regret his impetuosity in thrusting
      his card upon the man. Then, again, how he had let himself go on the
      subject of Lexington! How narrowly he had escaped compromise! He turned
      hot and cold at the recollection of what he had said and what he might
      have said. Then for the first time he paused in his walk and looked about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving Grosvenor Square he had turned westward, moving rapidly till
      the Marble Arch was reached; there, still oblivious to his surroundings,
      he had crossed the roadway to the Edgware Road, passing along it to the
      labyrinth of shabby streets that lie behind Paddington. Now, as he glanced
      about him, he saw with some surprise how far he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damp remnants of the fog still hung about the house-tops in a filmy
      veil; there were no glimpses of green to break the monotony of tone; all
      was quiet, dingy, neglected. But to Chilcote the shabbiness was restful,
      the subdued atmosphere a satisfaction. Among these sad houses, these
      passers-by, each filled with his own concerns, he experienced a sense of
      respite and relief. In the fashionable streets that bounded his own
      horizon, if a man paused in his walk to work out an idea he instantly drew
      a crowd of inquisitive or contemptuous eyes; here, if a man halted for
      half an hour it was nobody's business but his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjoying this thought, he wandered on for close upon an hour, moving from
      one street to another with steps that were listless or rapid, as
      inclination prompted; then, still acting with vagrant aimlessness, he
      stopped in his wanderings and entered a small eating-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was low-ceiled and dirty, the air hot and steaming with the
      smell of food, but Chilcote passed through the door and moved to one of
      the tables with no expression of disgust, and with far less furtive
      watchfulness than he used in his own house. By a curious mental twist he
      felt greater freedom, larger opportunities in drab surroundings such as
      these than in the broad issues and weighty responsibilities of his own
      life. Choosing a corner seat, he called for coffee; and there, protected
      by shadow and wrapped in cigarette smoke, he set about imagining himself
      some vagrant unit who had slipped his moorings and was blissfully adrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imagination was pleasant while it lasted, but with him nothing was
      permanent. Of late the greater part of his sufferings had been comprised
      in the irritable fickleness of all his aims&mdash;the distaste for and
      impossibility of sustained effort in any direction. He had barely lighted
      a second cigarette when the old restlessness fell upon him; he stirred
      nervously in his seat, and the cigarette was scarcely burned out when he
      rose, paid his small bill, and left the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside on the pavement he halted, pulled out his watch, and saw that two
      hours stretched in front before any appointment claimed his attention. He
      wondered vaguely where he might go to&mdash;what he might do in those two
      hours? In the last few minutes a distaste for solitude had risen in his
      mind, giving the close street a loneliness that had escaped him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood wavering a cab passed slowly down the street. The sight of a
      well-dressed man roused the cabman; flicking his whip, he passed Chilcote
      close, feigning to pull up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab suggested civilization. Chilcote's mind veered suddenly and he
      raised his hand. The vehicle stopped and he climbed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, sir?&rdquo; The cabman peered down through the roof-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote raised his head. &ldquo;Oh, anywhere near Pall Mall,&rdquo; he said. Then, as
      the horse started forward, he put up his hand and shook the trap-door.
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I've changed my mind. Drive to Cadogan Gardens&mdash;No.
      33.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The distance to Cadogan Gardens was covered quickly. Chilcote had hardly
      realized that his destination was reached when the cab pulled up. Jumping
      out, he paid the fare and walked quickly to the hall-door of No. 33.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Lady Astrupp at home?&rdquo; he asked, sharply, as the door swung back in
      answer to his knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant drew back deferentially. &ldquo;Her ladyship has almost finished
      lunch, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Chilcote stepped through the door-way and walked half-way
      across the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But don't disturb her on my account. I'll wait in
      the white room till she has finished.&rdquo; And, without taking further notice
      of the servant, he began to mount the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the room where he had chosen to wait a pleasant wood-fire brightened
      the dull January afternoon and softened the thick, white curtains, the
      gilt furniture, and the Venetian vases filled with white roses. Moving
      straight forward, Chilcote paused by the grate and stretched his hands to
      the blaze; then, with his usual instability, he turned and passed to a
      couch that stood a yard or two away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the couch, tucked away between a novel and a crystal gazing-ball, was a
      white Persian kitten, fast asleep. Chilcote picked up the ball and held it
      between his eyes and the fire; then he laughed superciliously, tossed it
      back into its place, and caught the kitten's tail. The little animal
      stirred, stretched itself, and began to purr. At the same moment the door
      of the room opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote turned round. &ldquo;I particularly said you were not to be disturbed,&rdquo;
       he began. &ldquo;Have I merited displeasure?&rdquo; He spoke fast, with the uneasy
      tone that so often underran his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Astrupp took his hand with a confiding gesture and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never displeasure,&rdquo; she said, lingeringly, and again she smiled. The
      smile might have struck a close observer as faintly, artificial. But what
      man in Chilcote's frame of mind has time to be observant where women are
      concerned? The manner of the smile was very sweet and almost caressing&mdash;and
      that sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; she asked, after a moment. &ldquo;I thought I was
      quite forgotten.&rdquo; She moved across to the couch, picked up the kitten, and
      kissed it. &ldquo;Isn't this sweet?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked very graceful as she turned, holding the little animal up. She
      was a woman of twenty-seven, but she looked a girl. The outline of her
      face was pure, the pale gold of her hair almost ethereal, and her tall,
      slight figure still suggested the suppleness, the possibility of future
      development, that belongs to youth. She wore a lace-colored gown that
      harmonized with the room and with the delicacy of her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now sit down and rest&mdash;or walk about the room. I sha'n't mind
      which.&rdquo; She nestled into the couch and picked up the crystal ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the toy for?&rdquo; Chilcote looked at her from the mantel-piece,
      against which he was resting. He had never defined the precise attraction
      that Lillian Astrupp held for him. Her shallowness soothed him; her
      inconsequent egotism helped him to forget himself. She never asked him how
      he was, she never expected impossibilities. She let him come and go and
      act as he pleased, never demanding reasons. Like the kitten, she was
      charming and graceful and easily amused; it was possible that, also like
      the kitten, she could scratch and be spiteful on occasion, but that did
      not weigh with him. He sometimes expressed a vague envy of the late Lord
      Astrupp; but, even had circumstances permitted, it is doubtful whether he
      would have chosen to be his successor. Lillian as a friend was delightful,
      but Lillian as a wife would have been a different consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the toy for?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up slowly. &ldquo;How cruel of you, Jack! It is my very latest
      hobby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was part of her attraction that she was never without a craze. Each new
      one was as fleeting as the last, but to each she brought the same
      delightfully insincere enthusiasm, the same picturesque devotion. Each was
      a pose, but she posed so sweetly that nobody lost patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't laugh!&rdquo; she protested, letting the kitten slip to the ground.
      &ldquo;I've had lessons at five guineas each from the most fascinating person&mdash;a
      professional; and I'm becoming quite an adept. Of course I haven't been
      much beyond the milky appearance yet, but the milky appearance is
      everything, you know; the rest will come. I am trying to persuade Blanche
      to let me have a pavilion at her party in March, and gaze for all you dull
      political people.&rdquo; Again she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote smiled as well. &ldquo;How is it done?&rdquo; he asked, momentarily amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the doing is quite delicious. You sit at a table with the ball in
      front of you; then you take the subject's hands, spread them out on the
      table, and stroke them very softly while you gaze into the crystal; that
      gets up the sympathy, you know.&rdquo; She looked up innocently. &ldquo;Shall I show
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote moved a small table nearer to the couch and spread his hands upon
      it, palms downward. &ldquo;Like this, eh?&rdquo; he said. Then a ridiculous
      nervousness seized him and he moved away. &ldquo;Some other day,&rdquo; he said,
      quickly. &ldquo;You can show me some other day. I'm not very fit this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Lillian felt any disappointment, she showed none. &ldquo;Poor old thing!&rdquo; she
      said, softly. &ldquo;Try to sit here by me and we won't bother about anything.&rdquo;
       She made a place for him beside her, and as he dropped into it she took
      his hand and patted it sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch was soothing, and he bore it patiently enough. After a moment
      she lifted the hand with a little exclamation of reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You degenerate person! You have ceased to manicure. What has become of my
      excellent training?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed. &ldquo;Run to seed,&rdquo; he said, lightly. Then his expression and
      tone changed. &ldquo;When a man gets to my age,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;little social
      luxuries don't seem worth while; the social necessities are irksome
      enough. Personally, I envy the beggar in the street&mdash;exempt from
      shaving, exempt from washing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lillian raised her delicate eyebrows. The sentiment was beyond her
      perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But manicuring,&rdquo; she said, reproachfully, &ldquo;when you have such nice hands.
      It was your hands and your eyes, you know, that first appealed to me.&rdquo; She
      sighed gently, with a touch of sentimental remembrance. &ldquo;And I thought it
      so strong of you not to wear rings&mdash;it must be such a temptation.&rdquo;
       She looked down at her own fingers, glittering with jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the momentary pleasure of her touch was gone. Chilcote drew away his
      hand and picked up the book that lay between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other Men's Shoes!&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;A novel, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;Of course. Such a fantastic story. Two men changing
      identities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote rose and walked back to the mantel-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changing identities?&rdquo; he said, with a touch of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. One man is an artist, the other a millionaire; one wants to know
      what fame is like, the other wants to know how it feels to be really
      sinfully rich. So they exchange experiences for a month.&rdquo; She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed as well. &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I told you the idea was absurd. Fancy two people so much alike that
      neither their friends nor their servants see any difference! Such a thing
      couldn't be, could it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote looked down at the fire. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, doubtfully. &ldquo;No. I
      suppose not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. There are likenesses, but not freak likenesses like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote's head was bent as she spoke, but at the last words he lifted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I don't know about that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not so very long ago I saw
      two men so much alike that I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He colored quickly. &ldquo;You doubt me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jack!&rdquo; Her voice was delicately reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think that my&mdash;my imagination has been playing me tricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy! Nothing of the kind. Come back to your place and tell me the
      whole tale?&rdquo; She smiled again, and patted the couch invitingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote's balance had been upset. For the first time he saw Lillian
      as one of the watchful, suspecting crowd before which he was constantly on
      guard. Acting on the sensation, he moved suddenly towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I have an appointment at the House,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;I'll look
      in another day when&mdash;when I'm better company. I know I'm a bear
      to-day. My nerves, you know.&rdquo; He came back to the couch and took her hand;
      then he touched her cheek for an instant with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take care of yourself&mdash;and the kitten,&rdquo; he
      added, with forced gayety, as he crossed the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Chilcote's nervous condition reached its height. All day he
      had avoided the climax, but no evasion can be eternal, and this he
      realized as he sat in his place on the Opposition benches during the
      half-hour of wintry twilight that precedes the turning-on of the lights.
      He realized it in that half-hour, but the application of the knowledge
      followed later, when the time came for him to question the government on
      some point relating to a proposed additional dry-dock at Talkley, the
      naval base. Then for the first time he knew that the sufferings of the
      past months could have a visible as well as a hidden side&mdash;could
      disorganize his daily routine as they had already demoralized his will and
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing came upon him with extraordinary lack of preparation. He sat
      through the twilight with tolerable calm, his nervousness showing only in
      the occasional lifting of his hand to his collar and the frequent changing
      of his position; but when the lights were turned on, and he leaned back in
      his seat with closed eyes, he became conscious of a curious impression&mdash;a
      disturbing idea that through his closed lids he could see the faces on the
      opposite side of the House, see the rows of eyes, sleepy, interested, or
      vigilant. Never before had the sensation presented itself, but, once set
      up, it ran through all his susceptibilities. By an absurd freak of fancy
      those varying eyes seemed to pierce through his lids, almost through his
      eyeballs. The cold perspiration that was his daily horror broke out on his
      forehead; and at the same moment Fraide, his leader, turned, leaned over
      the back of his seat, and touched his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote started and opened his eyes. &ldquo;I&mdash;I believe I was dozing,&rdquo; he
      said, confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraide smiled his dry, kindly smile. &ldquo;A fatal admission for a member of
      the Opposition,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I was looking for you earlier in the day,
      Chilcote. There is something behind this Persian affair. I believe it to
      be a mere first move on Russia's part. You big trading people will find it
      worth watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I scarcely
      believe in it. Lakely put a match to the powder in the 'St. George's', but
      'twill only be a noise and a puff of smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fraide did not smile. &ldquo;What is the feeling down at Wark?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;Has it awakened any interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Wark? Oh, I&mdash;I don't quite know. I have been a little out of
      touch with Wark in the last few weeks. A man has so many private affairs
      to look to&mdash;&rdquo; He was uneasy under his chief's scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraide's lips parted as if to make reply, but with a certain dignified
      reticence he closed them again and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote leaned back in his place and furtively passed his hand over his
      forehead. His mind was possessed by one consideration&mdash;the
      consideration of himself. He glanced down the crowded, lighted House to
      the big glass doors; he glanced about him at his colleagues, indifferent
      or interested; then surreptitiously his fingers strayed to his
      waistcoat-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually he carried his morphia tabloids with him, but to-day by a lapse of
      memory he had left them at home. He knew this, nevertheless he continued
      to search, while the need of the drug rushed through him with a sense of
      physical sickness. He lost hold on the business of the House;
      unconsciously he half rose from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man next him looked up. &ldquo;Hold your ground, Chilcote,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Rayforth is drying up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a wave of relief Chilcote dropped back into his place. Whatever the
      confusion in his mind, it was evidently not obvious in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayforth resumed his seat, there was the usual slight stir and pause, then
      Salett, the member for Salchester, rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Salett's first words Chilcote's hand again sought his pocket, and
      again his eyes strayed towards the doors, but Fraide's erect head and
      stiff back just in front of him held him quiet. With an effort he pulled
      out his notes and smoothed them nervously; but though his gaze was fixed
      on the pages, not a line of Blessington's clear writing reached his mind.
      He glanced at the face of the Speaker, then at the faces on the Treasury
      Bench, then once more he leaned back in his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man beside him saw the movement. &ldquo;Funking the drydock?&rdquo; he whispered,
      jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;Chilcote turned to him suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;but I feel beastly&mdash;have
      felt beastly for weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other looked at him more closely. &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; he asked. It was a
      novel experience to be confided in by Chilcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's the grind-the infernal grind.&rdquo; As he said it, it seemed to him
      suddenly that his strength gave way. He forgot his companion, his
      position, everything except the urgent instinct that filled mind and body.
      Scarcely knowing what he did, he rose and leaned forward to whisper in
      Fraide's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraide was seen to turn, his thin face interested and concerned, then he
      was seen to nod once or twice in acquiescence, and a moment later Chilcote
      stepped quietly out of his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two men spoke to him as he hurried from the House, but he shook
      them off almost uncivilly, and, making for the nearest exit, hailed a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive to Grosvenor Square was a misery. Time after time he changed
      from one corner of the cab to the other, his acute internal pains
      prolonged by every delay and increased by every motion. At last, weak in
      all his limbs, he stepped from the vehicle at his own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the house, he instantly mounted the stairs and passed to his own
      rooms. Opening the bedroom door, he peered in cautiously, then pushed the
      door wide. The light had been switched on, but the room was empty. With a
      nervous excitement scarcely to be kept in check, he entered, shut and
      locked the door, then moved to the wardrobe, and, opening it, drew the
      tube of tabloids from the shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand shook violently as he carried the tube to the table. The strain
      of the day, the anxiety of the past hours, with their final failure, had
      found sudden expression. Mixing a larger dose than any he had before
      allowed himself, he swallowed it hastily, and, walking across the room,
      threw himself, fully dressed, upon the bed.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      To those whose sphere lies in the west of London, Fleet Street is little
      more than a name, and Clifford's Inn a mere dead letter. Yet Clifford's
      Inn lies as safely stowed away in the shadow of the Law Courts as any
      grave under a country church wall; it is as green of grass, as gray of
      stone, as irresponsive to the passing footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing the railed-in grass-plot of its little court stood the house in
      which John Loder had his rooms. Taken at a first glance, the house had the
      deserted air of an office, inhabited only in the early hours; but, as
      night fell, lights would be seen to show out, first on one floor, then on
      another&mdash;faint, human beacons unconsciously signalling each other.
      The rooms Loder inhabited were on the highest floor; and from their
      windows one might gaze philosophically on the tree-tops, forgetting the
      uneven pavement and the worn railing that hemmed them round. In the
      landing outside the rooms his name appeared above his door, but the paint
      had been soiled by time, and the letters for the most part reduced to
      shadows; so that, taken in conjunction with the gaunt staircase and bare
      walls, the place had a cheerless look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside, however, the effect was somewhat mitigated. The room on the right
      hand, as one entered the small passage that served as hall, was of fair
      size, though low-ceiled. The paint of the wall-panelling, like the name
      above the outer door, had long ago been worn to a dirty and nondescript
      hue, and the floor was innocent of carpet; yet in the middle of the room
      stood a fine old Cromwell table, and on the plain deal book-shelves and
      along the mantel-piece were some valuable books&mdash;political and
      historical. There were no curtains on the windows, and a common
      reading-lamp with a green shade stood on a desk. It was the room of a man
      with few hobbies and no pleasures&mdash;who existed because he was alive,
      and worked because he must.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three nights after the great fog John Loder sat by his desk in the light
      of the green-shaded lamp. The remains of a very frugal supper stood on the
      centre-table, and in the grate a small and economical-looking fire was
      burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having written for close on two hours, he pushed back his chair and
      stretched his cramped fingers; then he yawned, rose, and slowly walked
      across the room. Reaching the mantel-piece, he took a pipe from the
      pipe-rack and some tobacco from the jar that stood behind the books. His
      face looked tired and a little worn, as is common with men who have worked
      long at an uncongenial task. Shredding the tobacco between his hands, he
      slowly filled the pipe, then lighted it from the fire with a spill of
      twisted paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the moment that he applied the light the sound of steps mounting
      the uncarpeted stairs outside caught his attention, and he raised his head
      to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the steps halted and he heard a match struck. The stranger was
      evidently uncertain of his whereabouts. Then the steps moved forward again
      and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expression of surprise crossed Loder's face, and he laid down his pipe.
      As the visitor knocked, he walked quietly across the room and opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage outside was dark, and the new-comer drew back before the light
      from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Loder&mdash;?&rdquo; he began, interrogatively. Then all at once he laughed
      in embarrassed apology. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The light rather dazzled
      me. I didn't realize who it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder recognized the voice as belonging to his acquaintance of the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Won't you come in?&rdquo; His voice was a little cold.
      This sudden resurrection left him surprised&mdash;and not quite pleasantly
      surprised. He walked back to the fireplace, followed by his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guest seemed nervous and agitated. &ldquo;I must apologize for the hour of
      my visit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My&mdash;my time is not quite my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder waved his hand. &ldquo;Whose time is his own?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, encouraged by the remark, drew nearer to the fire. Until this
      moment he had refrained from looking directly at his host; now, however,
      he raised his eyes, and, despite his preparation, he recoiled unavoidably
      before the extraordinary resemblance. Seen here, in the casual
      surroundings of a badly furnished and crudely lighted room, it was even
      more astounding than it had been in the mystery of the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;It is physical&mdash;purely physical. I am
      bowled over against my will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder smiled. The slight contempt that Chilcote had first inspired rose
      again, and with it a second feeling less easily defined. The man seemed so
      unstable, so incapable, yet so grotesquely suggestive to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The likeness is rather overwhelming,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but not heavy enough to
      sink under. Come nearer the fire. What brought you here? Curiosity?&rdquo; There
      was a wooden arm-chair by the fireplace. He indicated it with a wave of
      the hand; then turned and took up his smouldering pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, watching him furtively, obeyed the gesture and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extraordinary!&rdquo; he said, as if unable to dismiss the subject. &ldquo;It&mdash;it
      is quite extraordinary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other glanced round. &ldquo;Let's drop it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's so confoundedly
      obvious.&rdquo; Then his tone changed. &ldquo;Won't you smoke?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Chilcote began to fumble for his cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his host forestalled him. Taking a box from the mantel-piece, he held
      it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My one extravagance!&rdquo; he said, ironically. &ldquo;My resources bind me to one;
      and I think I have made a wise selection. It is about the only vice we
      haven't to pay for six times over.&rdquo; He glanced sharply at the face so
      absurdly like his own, then, lighting a fresh spill, offered his guest a
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote moistened his cigarette and leaned forward. In the flare of the
      paper his face looked set and anxious, but Loder saw that the lips did not
      twitch as they had done on the previous occasion that he had given him a
      light, and a look of comprehension crossed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you drink? Or, rather, will you have a whiskey? I keep nothing
      else. Hospitality is one of the debarred luxuries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote shook his head. &ldquo;I seldom drink. But don't let that deter you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder smiled. &ldquo;I have one drink in the twenty-four hours&mdash;generally
      at two o'clock, when my night's work is done. A solitary man has to look
      where he is going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You work till two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two&mdash;or three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote's eyes wandered to the desk. &ldquo;You write?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Books?&rdquo; Chilcote's tone was anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed, and the bitter note showed in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not books,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote leaned back in his chair and passed his hand across his face. The
      strong wave of satisfaction that the words woke in him was difficult to
      conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned aside. &ldquo;You must not ask that,&rdquo; he said, shortly. &ldquo;When a man
      has only one capacity, and the capacity has no outlet, he is apt to run to
      seed in a wrong direction. I cultivate weeds&mdash;at abominable labor and
      a very small reward.&rdquo; He stood with his back to the fire, facing his
      visitor; his attitude was a curious blending of pride, defiance, and
      despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote leaned forward again. &ldquo;Why speak of yourself like that? You are a
      man of intelligence and education.&rdquo; He spoke questioningly, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intelligence and education!&rdquo; Loder laughed shortly. &ldquo;London is cemented
      with intelligence. And education! What is education? The court dress
      necessary to presentation, the wig and gown necessary to the barrister.
      But do the wig and gown necessarily mean briefs? Or the court dress royal
      favor? Education is the accessory; it is influence that is essential. You
      should know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote moved restlessly in his seat. &ldquo;You talk bitterly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked up. &ldquo;I think bitterly, which is worse. I am one of the
      unlucky beggars who, in the expectation of money, has been denied a
      profession&mdash;even a trade, to which to cling in time of shipwreck; and
      who, when disaster comes, drift out to sea. I warned you the other night
      to steer clear of me. I come under the head of flotsam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote's face lighted. &ldquo;You came a cropper?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It was some one else who came the cropper&mdash;I only dealt in
      results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big results?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A drop from a probable eighty thousand pounds to a certain eight
      hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote glanced up. &ldquo;How did you take it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, I was twenty-five then. I had a good many hopes and a lot of
      pride; but there is no place for either in a working world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My last relation died with the fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laid down his pipe. &ldquo;I told you I was twenty-five,&rdquo; he said, with
      the tinge of humor that sometimes crossed his manner. &ldquo;Doesn't that
      explain things? I had never taken favors in prosperity; a change of
      fortune was not likely to alter my ways. As I have said, I was
      twenty-five.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;When I realized my position I sold all my
      belongings with the exception of a table and a few books&mdash;which I
      stored. I put on a walking-suit and let my beard grow; then, with my
      entire capital in my pocket, I left England without saying good-bye to any
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for six years. I wandered half over Europe and through a good part of
      Asia in the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then? Oh, I shaved off the beard and came back to London!&rdquo; He looked at
      Chilcote, partly contemptuous, partly amused at his curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote sat staring in silence. The domination of the other's
      personality and the futility of his achievements baffled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder saw his bewilderment. &ldquo;You wonder what the devil I came into the
      world for,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder the same myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his words a change passed over Chilcote. He half rose, then dropped
      back into his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no friends?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your life is worth nothing to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder raised his head. &ldquo;I thought I had conveyed that impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an absolutely free man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man is free who works for his bread. If things had been different I
      might have been in such shoes as yours, sauntering in legislative byways;
      my hopes turned that way once. But hopes, like more substantial things,
      belong to the past&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped abruptly and looked at his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change in Chilcote had become more acute; he sat fingering his
      cigarette, his brows drawn down, his lips set nervously in a conflict of
      emotions. For a space he stayed very still, avoiding Loder's eyes; then,
      as if decision had suddenly come to him, he turned and met his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How if there was a future,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as well as a past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the space of a minute there was silence in the room, then outside in
      the still night three clocks simultaneously chimed eleven, and their
      announcement was taken up and echoed by half a dozen others, loud and
      faint, hoarse and resonant; for all through the hours of darkness the
      neighborhood of Fleet Street is alive with chimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, startled by the jangle, rose from his seat; then, as if driven
      by an uncontrollable impulse, he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably think I am mad&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder took his pipe out of his mouth. &ldquo;I am not so presumptuous,&rdquo; he said,
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space the other eyed him silently, as if trying to gauge his
      thoughts; then once more he broke into speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I came to-night to make a proposition. When I have
      made it you'll first of all jeer at it&mdash;as I jeered when I made it to
      myself; then you'll see its possibilities&mdash;as I did; then,&rdquo;&mdash;he
      paused and glanced round the room nervously&mdash;&ldquo;then you'll accept it&mdash;as
      I did.&rdquo; In the uneasy haste of his speech his words broke off almost
      unintelligibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Loder lifted his head to retort, but Chilcote put up his
      hand. His face was set with the obstinate determination that weak men
      sometime exhibit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I begin I want to say that I am not drunk&mdash;that I am neither
      mad nor drunk.&rdquo; He looked fully at his companion with his restless glance.
      &ldquo;I am quite sane&mdash;quite reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder essayed to speak, but again he put up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Hear me out. You told me something of your story. I'll tell you
      something of mine. You'll be the first person, man or woman, that I have
      confided in for ten years. You say you have been treated shabbily. I have
      treated myself shabbily&mdash;which is harder to reconcile. I had every
      chance&mdash;and I chucked every chance away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a strained pause, then again Loder lifted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morphia?&rdquo; he said, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote wheeled round with a scared gesture. &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; he
      asked, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled. &ldquo;It wasn't guessing&mdash;it wasn't even deduction. You
      told me, or as good as told me, in the fog&mdash;when we talked of
      Lexington. You were unstrung that night, and I&mdash;Well, perhaps one
      gets over-observant from living alone.&rdquo; He smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote collapsed into his former seat and passed his handkerchief across
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder watched him for a space; then he spoke. &ldquo;Why don't you pull up?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;You are a young man still. Why don't you drop the thing before it
      gets too late?&rdquo; His face was unsympathetic, and below the question in his
      voice lay a note of hard ness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote returned his glance. The suggestion of reproof had accentuated
      his pallor. Under his excitement he looked ill and worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might talk till doomsday, but every word would be wasted,&rdquo; he said,
      irritably. &ldquo;I'm past praying for, by something like six years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why come here?&rdquo; Loder was pulling hard on his pipe. &ldquo;I'm not a
      dealer in sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't require sympathy.&rdquo; Chilcote rose again. He was still agitated,
      but the agitation was quieter. &ldquo;I want a much more expensive thing than
      sympathy&mdash;and I am willing to pay for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other turned and looked at him. &ldquo;I have no possession in the world
      that would be worth a fiver to you,&rdquo; he said, coldly. &ldquo;You're either under
      a delusion or you're wasting my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed nervously. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wait. I only ask you to
      wait. First let me sketch you my position&mdash;it won't take many words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather was a Chilcote of Westmoreland; he was one of the first of
      his day and his class to recognize that there was a future in trade, so,
      breaking his own little twig from the family tree, he went south to Wark
      and entered a ship-owning firm. In thirty years' time he died, the owner
      of one of the biggest trades in England, having married the daughter of
      his chief. My father was twenty-four and still at Oxford when he
      inherited. Almost his first act was to reverse my grandfather's early move
      by going north and piecing together the family friendship. He married his
      first cousin; and then, with the Chilcote prestige revived and the
      shipping money to back it, he entered on his ambition, which was to
      represent East Wark in the Conservative interest. It was a big fight, but
      he won&mdash;as much by personal influence as by any other. He was an
      aristocrat, but he was a keen business-man as well. The combination
      carries weight with your lower classes. He never did much in the House,
      but he was a power to his party in Wark. They still use his name there to
      conjure with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder leaned forward interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert Chilcote?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have heard of him. One of those fine,
      unostentatious figures&mdash;strong in action, a little narrow in outlook,
      perhaps, but essential to a country's staying power. You have every reason
      to be proud of your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed suddenly. &ldquo;How easily we sum up, when a matter is
      impersonal! My father may have been a fine figure, but he shouldn't have
      left me to climb to his pedestal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder's eyes questioned. In his newly awakened interest he had let his
      pipe go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you grasp my meaning?&rdquo; Chilcote went on. &ldquo;My father died and I was
      elected for East Wark. You may say that if I had no real inclination for
      the position I could have kicked. But I tell you I couldn't. Every local
      interest, political and commercial, hung upon the candidate being a
      Chilcote. I did what eight men out of ten would have done. I yielded to
      pressure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a fine opening!&rdquo; The words escaped Loder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most prisons have wide gates!&rdquo; Chilcote laughed again unpleasantly. &ldquo;That
      was six years ago. I had started on the morphia tack four years earlier,
      but up to my father's death I had it under my thumb&mdash;or believed I
      had; and in the realization of my new responsibilities and the excitement
      of the political fight I almost put it aside. For several months after I
      entered Parliament I worked. I believe I made one speech that marked me as
      a coming man.&rdquo; He laughed derisively. &ldquo;I even married&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A girl of nineteen&mdash;the ward of a great statesman. It was a
      brilliant marriage&mdash;politically as well as socially. But it didn't
      work. I was born without the capacity for love. First the social life
      palled on me; then my work grew irksome. There was only one factor to make
      life endurable&mdash;morphia. Before six months were out I had fully
      admitted that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my wife knew nothing&mdash;knows nothing. It is the political
      business, the beastly routine of the political life, that is wearing me
      out.&rdquo; He stopped nervously, then hurried on, again. &ldquo;I tell you it's hell
      to see the same faces, to sit in the same seat day in, day out, knowing
      all the time that you must hold yourself in hand, must keep your grip on
      the reins&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always possible to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To retire? Possible to retire?&rdquo; Chilcote broke into a loud, sarcastic
      laugh. &ldquo;You don't know what the local pressure of a place like Wark stands
      for. Twenty times I have been within an ace of chucking the whole thing.
      Once last year I wrote privately to Vale, one of our big men there, and
      hinted that my health was bad. Two hours after he had read my letter he
      was in my study. Had I been in Greenland the result would have been the
      same. No. Resignation is a meaningless word to a man like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked down. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you see everything&mdash;the difficulty, the isolation of the
      position. Five years ago&mdash;three&mdash;even two years ago&mdash;I was
      able to endure it; now it gets more unbearable with every month. The day
      is bound to come when&mdash;when&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, hesitating nervously&mdash;&ldquo;when
      it will be physically impossible for me to be at my post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Physically impossible,&rdquo; Chilcote repeated, excitedly. &ldquo;Until lately I was
      able to calculate&mdash;to count upon myself to some extent; but yesterday
      I received a shock&mdash;yesterday I discovered that&mdash;that&rdquo;&mdash;again
      he hesitated painfully&mdash;&ldquo;that I have passed the stage when one may
      calculate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The situation was growing more embarrassing. To hide its awkwardness,
      Loder moved back to the grate and rebuilt the fire, which had fallen low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, still excited by his unusual vehemence, followed him, taking up
      a position by the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very slowly Loder rose from his task. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, except that your story is unique, and that I suppose I am
      flattered by your confidence.&rdquo; His voice was intentionally brusque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote paid no attention to the voice. Taking a step forward, he laid
      his fingers on the lapel of Loder's coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have passed the stage where I can count upon myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
      want to count upon somebody else. I want to keep my place in the world's
      eyes and yet be free&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder drew back involuntarily, contempt struggling with bewilderment in
      his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote lifted his head. &ldquo;By an extraordinary chance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can
      do for me what no other man in creation could do. It was suggested to me
      unconsciously by the story of a book&mdash;a book in which men change
      identities. I saw nothing in it at the time, but this morning, as I lay in
      bed, sick with yesterday's fiasco, it came back to me&mdash;it rushed over
      my mind in an inspiration. It will save me&mdash;and make you. I'm not
      insulting you, though you'd like to think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without remark Loder freed himself from the other's touch and walked back
      to his desk. His anger, his pride, and, against his will, his excitement
      were all aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, leaned his elbow on the desk and took his face between his
      hands. The man behind him undoubtedly talked madness; but after five years
      of dreary sanity madness had a fascination. Against all reason it stirred
      and roused him. For one instant his pride and his anger faltered before
      it, then common-sense flowed back again and adjusted the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You propose,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;that for a consideration of money I
      should trade on the likeness between us&mdash;and become your dummy, when
      you are otherwise engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote colored. &ldquo;You are unpleasantly blunt,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have caught your meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the rough, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder nodded curtly. &ldquo;Then take my advice and go home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You're
      unhinged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other returned his glance, and as their eyes met Loder was reluctantly
      compelled to admit that, though the face was disturbed, it had no traces
      of insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make you a proposal,&rdquo; Chilcote repeated, nervously but with
      distinctness. &ldquo;Do you accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Loder was at a loss to find a reply sufficiently final.
      Chilcote broke in upon the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;what I ask of you is a simple thing. Merely to
      carry through my routine duties for a week or two occasionally when I find
      my endurance giving way&mdash;when a respite becomes essential. The work
      would be nothing to a man in your state of mind, the pay anything you like
      to name.&rdquo; In his eagerness he had followed Loder to the desk. &ldquo;Won't you
      give me an answer? I told you I am neither mad nor drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder pushed back the scattered papers that lay under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a lunatic would propose such a scheme.&rdquo; he said, brusquely and
      without feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other's lips parted for a quick retort; then in a surprising way the
      retort seemed to fail him. &ldquo;Oh, because the thing isn't feasible, isn't
      practicable from any point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote stepped closer. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it couldn't work, man! Couldn't hold for a dozen hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote put out his hand and touched his arm. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Why?
      Give me one unanswerable reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder shook off the hand and laughed, but below his laugh lay a suggestion
      of the other's excitement. Again the scene stirred him against his sounder
      judgment; though his reply, when it came, was firm enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for reasons&mdash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are a hundred, if I had time to
      name them. Take it, for the sake of supposition, that I were to accept
      your offer. I should take my place in your house at&mdash;let us say at
      dinnertime. Your man gets me into your evening-clothes, and there, at the
      very start, you have the first suspicion set up. He has probably known you
      for years&mdash;known you until every turn of your appearance, voice, and
      manner is far more familiar to him than it is to you. There are no eyes
      like a servant's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of that. My servant and my secretary can both be changed.
      I will do the thing thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder glanced at him in surprise. The madness had more method than he had
      believed. Then, as he still looked, a fresh idea struck him, and he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have entirely forgotten one thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can hardly dismiss
      your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife doesn't count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder laughed. &ldquo;I'm afraid I scarcely agree. The complications would
      be slightly&mdash;slightly&mdash;&rdquo; He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote's latent irritability broke out suddenly. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;this isn't a chaffing matter, It may be moonshine to you, but it's
      reality to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder took his face between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ridicule the idea. I'm in dead earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think&mdash;think it over before you refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Loder remained motionless; then h rose suddenly, pushing back
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, man! You don't know what you say. The fact of your being married
      bars it. Can't you see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misunderstand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You mistake the position. I tell you my
      wife and I are nothing to each other. She goes her way; I go mine. We have
      our own friends, our own rooms. Marriage, actual marriage, doesn't enter
      the question. We meet occasionally at meals, and at other people's houses;
      sometimes we go out together for the sake of appearances; beyond that,
      nothing. If you take up my life, nobody in it will trouble you less than
      Eve&mdash;I can promise that.&rdquo; He laughed unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder's face remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even granting that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the thing is still impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the House. The position there would be untenable. A man is known
      there as he is known in his own club.&rdquo; He drew away from Chilcote's touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly. Very possibly.&rdquo; Chilcote laughed quickly and excitedly.
      &ldquo;But what club is without its eccentric member? I am glad you spoke of
      that. I am glad you raised that point. It was a long time ago that I hit
      upon a reputation for moods as a shield for&mdash;for other things, and,
      the more useful it has become, the more I have let it grow. I tell you you
      might go down to the House to-morrow and spend the whole day without
      speaking to, even nodding to, a single man, and as long as you were I to
      outward appearances no one would raise an eyebrow. In the same way you
      might vote in my place ask a question, make a speech if you wanted to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word speech Loder turned involuntarily For a fleeting second the
      coldness of his manner dropped and his face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, with his nervous quickness of perception, saw the alteration,
      and a new look crossed his own face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;You once had ambitions in that direction.
      Why not renew the ambitions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And drop back from the mountains into the gutter?&rdquo; Loder smiled and
      slowly shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better to live for one day than to exist for a hundred!&rdquo; Chilcote's voice
      trembled with anxiety. For the third time he extended his hand and touched
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Loder did not shake off the detaining; hand; he scarcely seemed
      to feel its pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here.&rdquo; Chilcote's fingers tightened. &ldquo;A little while ago you talked
      of influence. Here you can step into a position built by influence. You
      might do all you once hoped to do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder suddenly lifted his head. &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Absurd! Such a scheme
      was never carried through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely why it will succeed. People never suspect until they have a
      precedent. Will you consider it? At least consider it. Remember, if there
      is a risk, it is I who am running it. On your own showing, you have no
      position to jeopardize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I go to-night will you promise me to consider it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will send me your decision by wire to-morrow. I won't take your
      answer now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder freed his arm abruptly. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote smiled nervously. &ldquo;Because I know men&mdash;and men's
      temptations. We are all very strong till the quick is touched; then we all
      wince. It's morphia with one man, ambitions with another. In each case
      it's only a matter of sooner or later.&rdquo; He laughed in his satirical,
      unstrung way, and held out his hand. &ldquo;'You have my address,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Au
      revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder pressed the hand and dropped it. &ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; he said, meaningly. Then
      he crossed the room quietly and held the door open. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said
      again as the other passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he crossed the threshold, Chilcote paused. &ldquo;Au revoir,&rdquo; he corrected,
      with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the last echo of his visitor's steps had died away Loder stood with
      his hand on the door; then, closing it quietly, he turned and looked round
      the room. For a considerable space he stood there as if weighing the
      merits of each object; then very slowly he moved to one of the
      book-shelves, drew out May's Parliamentary Practice, and, carrying it to
      the desk, readjusted the lamp.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the next day Chilcote moved in a fever of excitement. Hot with hope
      one moment, cold with fever the next, he rushed with restless energy into
      every task that presented itself&mdash;only to drop it as speedily. Twice
      during the morning he drove to the entrance of Clifford's Inn, but each
      time his courage failed him and he returned to Grosvenor Square&mdash;to
      learn that the expected message from Loder had not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wearing condition of mind; but at worst it was scarcely more than
      an exaggeration of what his state had been for months, and made but little
      obvious difference in his bearing or manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he took his place in the House, but, though it was his
      first appearance since his failure of two days ago, he drew but small
      personal notice. When he chose, his manner could repel advances with
      extreme effect, and of late men had been prone to draw away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the lobbies he encountered Fraide surrounded by a group of
      friends. With his usual furtive haste he would have passed on; but, moving
      away from his party, the old man accosted him. He was always courteously
      particular in his treatment of Chilcote, as the husband of his ward and
      godchild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better, Chilcote?&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the low, rather formal tones, so characteristic of the old
      statesman, a hundred memories rose to Chilcote's mind, a hundred hours,
      distasteful in the living and unbearable in the recollection; and with
      them the new flash of hope, the new possibility of freedom. In a sudden
      rush of confidence he turned to his leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I've found a remedy for my nerves,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I believe
      I'm going to be anew man.&rdquo; He laughed with a touch of excitement,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraide pressed his fingers kindly, &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is
      right. I called at Grosvenor Square this morning, but Eve told me your
      illness of the other day was not serious. She was very busy this morning&mdash;she
      could only spare me a quarter of an hour. She is indefatigable over the
      social side of your prospects. Chilcote. You owe her a large debt. A
      popular wife means a great deal to a politician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steady eyes of his companion disturbed Chilcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew away his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve is unique,&rdquo; he said, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraide smiled. &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;Admiration is too largely
      excluded from modern marriages.&rdquo; And with a courteous excuse he rejoined
      his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dinner-time before Chilcote could desert the House, but the moment
      departure was possible he hurried to Grosvenor Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the house, the hall was empty. He swore irritably under his
      breath and pressed the nearest bell. Since his momentary exaltation in
      Fraide's presence, his spirits had steadily fallen, until now they hung at
      the lowest ebb.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he waited in unconcealed impatience for an answer to his summons, he
      caught sight of his man Allsopp at the head of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; he called, pleased to find some one upon whom to vent his
      irritation. &ldquo;Has that wire come for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I inquired five minutes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inquire again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Allsopp disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second after his disappearance the bell of the hall door whizzed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chileote started. All sudden sounds, like all strong lights, affected him.
      He half moved to the door, then stopped himself with a short exclamation.
      At the same instant Allsopp reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote turned on him excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil's the meaning of this?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A battery of servants in
      the house and nobody to open the hall door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allsopp looked embarrassed. &ldquo;Crapham is coming directly, sir. He only left
      the hall to ask Jeffries&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote turned. &ldquo;Confound Crapham!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Go and open the door
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allsopp hesitated, his dignity struggling with his obedience. As he
      waited, the bell sounded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; Chilcote said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Allsopp crossed the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door was opened Chilcote passed his handkerchief from one hand to
      the other in the tension of hope and fear; then, as the sound of his own
      name in the shrill tones of a telegraph-boy reached his ears, he let the
      handkerchief drop to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allsopp took the yellow envelope and carried it to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A telegram, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And the boy wishes to know if there is an
      answer.&rdquo; Picking up Chilcote's handkerchief, he turned aside with
      elaborate dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote's hands were so unsteady that he could scarcely insert his finger
      under the flap of the envelope. Tearing off a corner, he wrenched the
      covering apart and smoothed out the flimsy pink paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message was very simple, consisting of but seven words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Shall expect you at eleven to-night.-LODER.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He read it two or three times, then he looked up. &ldquo;No answer,&rdquo; he said,
      mechanically; and to his own ears the relief in his voice sounded harsh
      and unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly as the clocks chimed eleven Chilcote mounted the stairs to Loder's
      rooms. But this time there was more of haste than of uncertainty in his
      steps, and, reaching the landing, he crossed it in a couple of strides and
      knocked feverishly on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It opened at once, and Loder stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion was peculiar. For a moment neither spoke; each involuntarily
      looked at the other with new eyes and under changed conditions. Each had
      assumed a fresh stand-point in the other's thought. The passing
      astonishment, the half-impersonal curiosity that had previously tinged
      their relationship, was cast aside, never to be reassumed. In each, the
      other saw himself&mdash;and something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, Loder was the first to recover himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was expecting you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Won't you come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were almost the same as his words of the night before, but his
      voice had a different ring; just as his face, when he drew back into the
      room, had a different expression&mdash;a suggestion of decision and energy
      that had been lacking before. Chilcote caught the difference as he crossed
      the threshold, and for a bare second a flicker of something like jealousy
      touched him. But the sensation was fleeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to thank you!&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand. He was too well bred
      to show by a hint that he understood the drop in the other's principles.
      But Loder broke down the artifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's be straight with each other, since everybody else has to be
      deceived,&rdquo; he said, taking the other's hand. &ldquo;You have nothing to thank me
      for, and you know it. It's a touch of the old Adam. You tempted me, and I
      fell.&rdquo; He laughed, but below the laugh ran a note of something like
      triumph&mdash;the curious triumph of a man who has known the tyranny of
      strength and suddenly appreciates the freedom of a weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fully realize the thing you have proposed?&rdquo; he added, in a different
      tone. &ldquo;It's not too late to retract, even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote opened his lips, paused, then laughed in imitation of his
      companion; but the laugh sounded forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I never retract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the bargain's sealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder walked slowly across the room, and, taking up his position by the
      mantel-piece, looked at his companion. The similarity between them as they
      faced each other seemed abnormal, defying even the closest scrutiny. And
      yet, so mysterious is Nature even in her lapses, they were subtly,
      indefinably different. Chilcote was Loder deprived of one essential:
      Loder, Chilcote with that essential bestowed. The difference lay neither
      in feature, in coloring, nor in height, but in that baffling, illusive
      inner illumination that some call individuality, and others soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this idea, misted and tangled by nervous imagination, crossed
      Chilcote's mind in that moment of scrutiny, but he shrank from it
      apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I came to discuss details,&rdquo; he said, quickly, crossing the space
      that divided him from his host. &ldquo;Shall we&mdash;? Are you&mdash;?&rdquo; He
      paused uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm entirely in your hands.&rdquo; Loder spoke with abrupt decision. Moving to
      the table, he indicated a chair, and drew another forward for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote leaned forward, resting elbows on the table. &ldquo;There will be
      several things to consider&mdash;&rdquo; he began, nervously, looking across at
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo; Loder glanced back appreciatively. &ldquo;I thought about those
      things the better part of last night. To begin with, I must study your
      handwriting. I guarantee to get it right, but it will take a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps three weeks. We mustn't make a mess of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote shifted his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three weeks!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Couldn't you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I couldn't.&rdquo; Loder spoke authoritatively. &ldquo;I might never want to put
      pen to paper, but, on the other hand, I might have to sign a check one
      day.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Have you ever thought of that?&mdash;that I might have
      to, or want to, sign a check?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I confess that escaped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You risk your fortune that you, may keep the place it bought for you?&rdquo;
       Loder laughed again. &ldquo;How do you know that I am not a blackguard?&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;How do you know that I won't clear out one day and leave you high
      and dry? What is to prevent John Chilcote from realizing forty or fifty
      thousand pounds and then making himself scarce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't do that,&rdquo; Chilcote said, with unusual decision. &ldquo;I told you
      your weakness last night; and it wasn't money. Money isn't the rock you'll
      split over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I'll split upon some rock? But that's beyond the question.
      To get to business again. You'll risk my studying your signature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! Now item two.&rdquo; Loder counted on his: fingers. &ldquo;I must know the
      names and faces of your men friends as far as I can. Your woman friends
      don't count. While I'm you, you will be adamant.&rdquo; He laughed again
      pleasantly. &ldquo;But the men are essential&mdash;the backbone of the whole
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no men friends. I don't trust the idea of friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acquaintances, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote looked up sharply. &ldquo;I think we score there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have a
      reputation for absent-mindedness that will carry you anywhere. They tell
      me I can look through the most substantial man in the House as if he were
      gossamer, though I may have lunched with him the same day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder smiled. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Fate Must have been constructing
      this before either of us was born. It dovetails ridiculously. But I must
      know your colleagues&mdash;even if it's only to cut them. You'll have to
      take me to the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; Again the tone of authority fell to Loder. &ldquo;I can pull my
      hat over my eyes and turn up my coat-collar. Nobody will notice me. We can
      choose the fall of the afternoon. I promise you 'twill be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose the likeness should leak out? It's a risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed confidently. &ldquo;Tush, man! Risk is the salt of life. I must
      see you at your post, and I must see the men you work with.&rdquo; He rose,
      walked across the room, and took his pipe from the rack. &ldquo;When I go in for
      a thing, I like to go in over head and ears,&rdquo; he added, as he opened his
      tobacco-jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pipe filled, he resumed his seat, resting his elbows on the table in
      unconscious imitation of Chilcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a match?&rdquo; he said, laconically, holding out his band.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response Chilcote drew his match-box from his pocket and struck a
      light. As their hands touched, an exclamation escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, with a fretful mixture of disappointment and surprise.
      &ldquo;I hadn't noticed that!&rdquo; His eyes were fixed in annoyed interest on
      Loder's extended hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, following his glance, smiled. &ldquo;Odd that we should both have
      overlooked it! It clean escaped my mind. It's rather an ugly scar.&rdquo; He
      lifted his hand till the light fell more fully on it. Above the second
      joint of the third finger ran a jagged furrow, the reminder of a wound
      that had once laid bare the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote leaned forward. &ldquo;How did you come by it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Oh, that's ancient history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The results are present-day enough. It's very awkward! Very annoying!&rdquo;
       Chilcote's spirits, at all times overeasily played upon, were damped by
      this obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, still looking at his hand, didn't seem to hear. &ldquo;There's only one
      thing to be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Each wear two rings on the third finger of
      the left hand. Two rings ought to cover it.&rdquo; He made a speculative
      measurement with the stem of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote still looked irritable and disturbed. &ldquo;I detest rings. I never
      wear rings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder raised his eyes calmly. &ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But there's no
      reason for bigotry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote's irritability was started. He pushed back his chair. &ldquo;I
      don't like the idea,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other eyed him amusedly. &ldquo;What a queer beggar you are!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      waive the danger of a man signing your checks and shy at wearing a piece
      of jewelry. I'll have a fair share of individuality to study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote moved restlessly. &ldquo;Everybody knows I detest jewelry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody knows you are capricious. It's got to be the rings or nothing,
      so far as I make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote again altered his position, avoiding the other's eyes. At last,
      after a struggle with himself, he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you're right!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have it your own way.&rdquo; It was the
      first small, tangible concession to the stronger will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder took his victory quietly. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then it's all straight
      sailing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except for the matter of the&mdash;the remuneration.&rdquo; Chilcote hazarded
      the word uncertainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint pause, then Loder laughed brusquely. &ldquo;My pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other was embarrassed. &ldquo;I didn't want to put it quite like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was what you thought. Why are you never honest&mdash;even with
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote drew his chair closer to the table. He did not attend to the
      other's remark, but his fingers strayed to his waistcoat pocket and
      fumbled there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder saw the gesture. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are overtaxing yourself.
      The affair of the pay isn't pressing; we'll shelve it to another night.
      You look tired out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote lifted his eyes with a relieved glance. &ldquo;Thanks. I do feel a bit
      fagged. If I may, I'll have that whiskey that I refused last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly.&rdquo; Loder rose at once and crossed to a cupboard in the
      wall. In silence he brought out whiskey, glasses, and a siphon of
      soda-water. &ldquo;Say when!&rdquo; he said, lifting the whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now. And I'll have plain water instead of soda, if it's all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite.&rdquo; Loder recrossed the room. Instantly his back was turned,
      Chilcote drew a couple of tabloids from his pocket and dropped them into
      his glass. As the other came slowly back he laughed nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. See to your own drink now; I can manage this.&rdquo; He took the jug
      unceremoniously, and, carefully guarding his glass from the light, poured
      in the water with excited haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we drink to?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder methodically mixed his own drink and lifted the glass. &ldquo;Oh, to the
      career of John Chilcote!&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the other hesitated. There was something prophetic in the
      sound of the toast. But he shook the feeling off and held up his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the career of John Chilcote!&rdquo; he said, with another unsteady laugh.
    </p>

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a little less than three weeks since Chilcote and Loder had drunk
      their toast, and again Loder was seated at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was bent and his hand moved carefully as he traced line after
      line of meaningless words on a sheet of foolscap. Having covered the page
      with writing, he rose, moved to the centre-table, and compared his task
      with an open letter that lay there. The comparison seemed to please him;
      he straightened his shoulders and threw back his head in an attitude of
      critical satisfaction. So absorbed was he that, when a step sounded on the
      stairs outside, he did not notice it, and only raised his head when the
      door was thrown open unceremoniously. Even then his interest was
      momentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said, his eyes returning to their scrutiny of his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote shut the door and came hastily across the room. He looked ill and
      harassed. As he reached Loder he put out his hand nervously and touched
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked up. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Any new development?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote tried to smile. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, huskily; &ldquo;it's come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder freed his arm. &ldquo;What? The end of the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The end of me.&rdquo; The words came jerkily, the strain that had enforced
      them showing in every syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Loder was uncomprehending; he could not, or would not, understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote caught and jerked at his sleeve. &ldquo;Don't you see? Can't you
      see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote dropped the sleeve and passed his handkerchief across his
      forehead. &ldquo;It's come,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Don't you understand? I want you.&rdquo; He
      drew away, then stepped back again anxiously. &ldquo;I know I'm taking you
      unawares,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it's not my fault. On my soul, it's not! The
      thing seems to spring at me and grip me&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, sinking weakly
      into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Loder stood erect and immovable&mdash;then, almost with
      reluctance, his glance turned to the figure beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to take your place to-night&mdash;without preparation?&rdquo; His
      voice was distinct and firm, but it was free from contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; yes, I do.&rdquo; Chilcote spoke without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may spend the night in morphia&mdash;this and other nights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote lifted a flushed, unsettled face. &ldquo;You have no right to preach.
      You accepted the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder raised his head quickly. &ldquo;I never&mdash;&rdquo; he began; then both his
      face and voice altered. &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; he said, coldly. &ldquo;You won't
      have to complain again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote stirred uncomfortably. &ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I meant no
      offence. It's merely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nerves. I know. But come to business. What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote rose excitedly. &ldquo;Yes, business. Let's come to business. It's
      rough on you, taking you short like this. But you have an erratic person
      to deal with. I've had a horrible day&mdash;a horrible day.&rdquo; His face had
      paled again, and in the green lamplight it possessed a grayish hue.
      Involuntarily Loder turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote watched him as he passed to the desk and began mechanically
      sorting papers. &ldquo;A horrible day!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;So bad that I daren't face
      the night. You have read De Quincey?&rdquo; he asked, with a sudden change of
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then read him again and you'll understand. I have all the horrors&mdash;without
      any art. I have no 'Ladies of Sorrow,' but I have worse monsters than his
      'crocodile'.&rdquo; He laughed unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned. &ldquo;Why in the devil's name&mdash;&rdquo; he began; then again he
      halted. Something in Chilcote's drawn, excited face checked him. The
      strange sense of predestination that we sometimes see in the eyes of
      another struck cold upon him, chilling his last attempt at remonstrance.
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; he substituted, in an ordinary voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words steadied Chilcote. He laughed a little. The laugh was still
      shaky, but it was pitched in a lower key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you're quite right to pull me up. We have no time to waste. It
      must be one o'clock.&rdquo; He pulled out his watch, then walked to the window
      and stood looking down into the shadowy court. &ldquo;How quiet you are here!&rdquo;
       he said. Then abruptly anew thought struck him and he wheeled back into
      the room. &ldquo;Loder,&rdquo; he said, quickly&mdash;-&ldquo;Loder, I have an idea! While
      you are me, why shouldn't I be you? Why shouldn't I be John Loder instead
      of the vagrant we contemplated? It covers everything&mdash;it explains
      everything. It's magnificent! I'm amazed we never thought of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder was still beside the desk. &ldquo;I thought of it,&rdquo; he said, without
      looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didn't suggest it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder said nothing and the other colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealous of your reputation?&rdquo; he said, satirically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none to be jealous of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed disagreeably. &ldquo;Then you aren't so for gone in philosophy
      as I thought. You have a niche in your own good opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder was silent; then he smiled. &ldquo;You have an oddly correct
      perception at times,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose I have had a lame sort of pride
      in keeping my name clean. But pride like that is out of fashion&mdash;and
      I've got to float with the tide.&rdquo; He laughed, the short laugh that
      Chilcote had heard once or twice before, and, crossing the room, he stood
      beside his visitor. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what business have I with
      pride, straight or lame? Have my identity, if you want it. When all
      defences have been broken down one barrier won't save the town.&rdquo; Laughing
      again, he laid his hand on the other's arm. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give your
      orders. I capitulate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the two men passed from Loder's bed room, where the final
      arrangements had been completed, back into the sitting-room. Loder came
      first, in faultless evening-dress. His hair was carefully brushed, the
      clothes he wore fitted him perfectly. To any glance, critical or casual,
      he was the man who had mounted the stairs and entered the rooms earlier in
      the evening. Chilcote's manner of walking and poise of the head seemed to
      have descended upon him with Chilcote's clothes. He came into the room
      hastily and passed to the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no private papers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so I have nothing to lock up.
      Everything can stand as it is. A woman named Robins comes in the mornings
      to clean up and light the fire; otherwise you must shift for yourself.
      Nobody will disturb you. Quiet, dead quiet, is about the one thing you can
      count on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, half halting in the doorway, made an attempt to laugh. Of the
      two, he was noticeably the more embarrassed. In Loder's well-worn,
      well-brushed tweed suit he felt stranded on his own personality, bereft
      for the moment of the familiar accessories that helped to cloak
      deficiencies and keep the wheel of conventionality comfortably rolling. He
      stood unpleasantly conscious of himself, unable to shape his sensations
      even in thought. He glanced at the fire, at the table, finally at the
      chair on which he had thrown his overcoat before entering the bedroom. At
      the sight of the coat his gaze brightened, the aimlessness forsook him,
      and he gave an exclamation of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I clean forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Loder looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rings.&rdquo; He crossed to the coat and thrust his hand into the pocket.
      &ldquo;The duplicates only arrived this afternoon. The nick of time, eh?&rdquo; He
      spoke fast, his fingers searching busily. Occupation of any kind came as a
      boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder slowly followed him, and as the box was brought to light he leaned
      forward interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I told you, one is the copy of an old signet-ring, the other a plain
      band&mdash;a plain gold band like a wedding-ring.&rdquo; Chilcote laughed as he
      placed the four rings side by side on his palm. &ldquo;I could think of nothing
      else that would be wide&mdash;and not ostentatious. You know how I detest
      display.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder touched the rings. &ldquo;You have good taste,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let's see if
      they serve their purpose?&rdquo; He picked them up and carried them to the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote followed him. &ldquo;That was an ugly wound,&rdquo; he said, his curiosity
      reawakening as Loder extended his finger. &ldquo;How did you come by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled. &ldquo;It's a memento,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of bravery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Quite the reverse.&rdquo; He looked again at his hand, then glanced back at
      Chilcote. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated, with an unusual impulse of confidence. &ldquo;It
      serves to remind me that I am not exempt&mdash;that I have been fooled
      like other men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That implies a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Again Loder looked at the scar on his finger. &ldquo;I seldom recall the
      thing, it's so absolutely past. But I rather like to remember it to-night.
      I rather want you to know that I've been through the fire. It's a sort of
      guarantee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote made a hasty gesture, but the other interrupted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you trust me. But you're giving me a risky post. I want you to
      see that women are out of my line&mdash;quite out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear chap&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder went on without heeding. &ldquo;This thing happened eight years ago at
      Santasalare,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a little place between Luna and Pistoria&mdash;a
      mere handful of houses wedged between two hills. A regular relic of old
      Italy crumbling away under flowers and sunshine, with nothing to suggest
      the present century except the occasional passing of a train round the
      base of one of the hills. I had literally stumbled upon the place on a
      long tramp south from Switzerland, and had been tempted into a stay at the
      little inn. The night after my arrival something unusual occurred. There
      was an accident to the train at the point where it skirted the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a small excitement; all the inhabitants were anxious to help,
      and I took my share. As a matter of fact, the smash was not disastrous;
      the passengers were hurt and frightened, but nobody was killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked at his companion, but, seeing him interested, went
      on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among these passengers was an English lady. Of all concerned in the
      business, she was the least upset. When I came upon her she was sitting on
      the shattered door of one of the carriages, calmly rearranging her hat. On
      seeing me she looked up with the most charming smile imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I have just been waiting for somebody like you,' she said. 'My stupid
      maid has got herself smashed up somewhere in the second-class carriages,
      and I have nobody to help me to find my dog.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, that first speech ought to have enlightened me, but it didn't.
      I only saw the smile and heard the voice; I knew nothing of whether they
      were deep or shallow. So I found the maid and found the dog. The first
      expressed gratitude; the other didn't. I extricated him with enormous
      difficulty from the wreck of the luggage-van, and this was how he marked
      his appreciation.&rdquo; He held out his hand and nodded towards the scar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote glanced up. &ldquo;So that's the explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I tried to conceal the thing when I restored the dog, but I was
      bleeding abominably and I failed. Then the whole business was changed. It
      was I who needed seeing to, my new friend insisted; I who should be looked
      after, and not she. She forgot the dog in the newer interest of my wounded
      finger. The maid, who was practically unhurt, was sent on to engage rooms
      at the little inn, and she and I followed slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That walk impressed me. There was an attractive mistiness of atmosphere
      in the warm night, a sensation more than attractive in being made much of
      by a woman of one's own class and country after five years' wandering.&rdquo; He
      laughed with a touch of irony. &ldquo;But I won't take up your time with
      details. You know the progress of an ordinary love affair. Throw in a few
      more flowers and a little more sunshine than is usual, a man who is
      practically a hermit and a woman who knows the world by heart, and you
      have the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She insisted on staying in Santasalare for three days in order to keep my
      finger bandaged; she ended by staying three weeks in the hope of smashing
      up my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On coming to the hotel she had given no name; and in our first
      explanations to each other she led me to conclude her an unmarried girl.
      It was at the end of the three weeks that I learned that she was not a
      free agent, as I had innocently imagined, but possessed a husband whom she
      had left ill with malaria at Florence or Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news disconcerted me, and I took no pains to hide it. After that the
      end came abruptly. In her eyes I had become a fool with middle-class
      principles; in my eyes&mdash;But there is no need for that. She left
      Santasalare the same night in a great confusion of trunks and hat-boxes;
      and next morning I strapped on my knapsack and turned my face to the
      south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And women don't count ever after?&rdquo; Chilcote smiled, beguiled out of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed. &ldquo;That's what I've been trying to convey. Once bitten, twice
      shy!&rdquo; He laughed again and slipped the two rings over his finger with an
      air of finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, shall I start? This is the latch-key?&rdquo; He drew a key from the pocket
      of Chilcote's evening-clothes. &ldquo;When I get to Grosvenor Square I am to
      find your house, go straight in, mount the stairs, and there on my right
      hand will be the door of your&mdash;I mean my own&mdash;private rooms. I
      think I've got it all by heart. I feel inspired; I feel that I can't go
      wrong.&rdquo; He handed the two remaining rings to Chilcote and picked up the
      overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stick on till I get a wire&mdash;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then I'll come back
      and we'll reverse again.&rdquo; He slipped on the coat and moved back towards
      the table. Now that the decisive moment had come, it embarrassed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely knowing how to bring it to an end, he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote took it, paling a little. &ldquo;'Twill be all right!&rdquo; he said, with a
      sudden return of nervousness. &ldquo;'Twill be all right! And I've made it plain
      about&mdash;about the remuneration? A hundred a week&mdash;besides all
      expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder smiled again. &ldquo;My pay? Oh yes, you've made it clear as day. Shall we
      say good-night now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange, distant note in Chilcote's voice, but the other did
      not pretend to hear it. He pressed the hand he was holding, though the
      cold dampness of it repelled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood for a moment, awkwardly looking at each other, then Loder
      quietly disengaged his hand, crossed the room, and passed through the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, left standing alone in the middle of the room, listened while
      the last sound of the other's footsteps was audible on the uncarpeted
      stairs; then, with a furtive, hurried gesture, he caught up the
      green-shaded lamp and passed into Loder's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0008" id="link2H_4_0008">
      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>

    <div style="height: 4em;">

    </div>
    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      To all men come portentous moments, difficult moments, triumphant moments.
      Loder had had his examples of all three, but no moment in his career ever
      equalled in strangeness of sensation that in which, dressed in another
      man's clothes, he fitted the latchkey for the first time into the door of
      the other man's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The act was quietly done. The key fitted the lock smoothly and his fingers
      turned it without hesitation, though his heart, usually extremely steady,
      beat sharply for a second. The hall loomed massive and sombre despite the
      modernity of electric lights. It was darkly and expensively decorated in
      black and brown; a frieze of wrought bronze, representing peacocks with
      outspread tails, ornamented the walls; the banisters were of heavy
      iron-work, and the somewhat formidable fireplace was of the same dark
      metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked about him, then advanced, his heart again beating quickly as
      his hand touched the cold banister and he began his ascent of the stairs.
      But at each step his confidence strengthened, his feet became more firm;
      until, at the head of the stairs, as if to disprove his assurance, his
      pulses played him false once more, this time to a more serious tune. From
      the farther end of a well-lighted corridor a maid was coming straight in
      his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one short second all things seemed to whiz about him; the certainty of
      detection overpowered his mind. The indisputable knowledge that he was
      John Loder and no other, despite all armor of effrontery and dress, so
      dominated him that all other considerations shrank before it. It wanted
      but one word, one simple word of denunciation, and the whole scheme was
      shattered. In the dismay of the moment, he almost wished that the word
      might be spoken and the suspense ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the maid came on in silence, and so incredible was the silence that
      Loder moved onward, too. He came within a yard of her, and still she did
      not speak; then, as he passed her, she drew back respectfully against the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strain, so astonishingly short, had been immense, but with its
      slackening came a strong reaction. The expected humiliation seethed
      suddenly to a desire to dare fate. Pausing quickly, he turned and called
      the woman back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot where he had halted was vividly bright, the ceiling light being
      directly above his head; and as she came towards him he raised his face
      deliberately and-waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him without surprise or interest. &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your mistress in?&rdquo; he asked. He could think of no other question, but
      it served his purpose as a test of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the woman showed no surprise. &ldquo;She's not in sir,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But
      she's expected in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour? All right! That's all I wanted.&rdquo; With a movement of
      decision Loder walked back to the stair-head, turned to the right, and
      opened the door of Chilcote's rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened on a short, wide passage; on one side stood the study, on
      the other the bed, bath, and dressing-rooms. With a blind sense of
      knowledge and unfamiliarity, bred of much description on Chilcote's part,
      he put his hand on the study door and, still exalted by the omen of his
      first success, turned the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the room there was firelight and lamplight and a studious air of
      peace. The realization of this and a slow incredulity at Chilcote's
      voluntary renunciation were his first impressions; then his attention was
      needed for more imminent things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered, the new secretary was returning a volume to its place on
      the book-shelves. At sight of him, he pushed it hastily into position and
      turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was making a few notes on the political position of Khorasan,&rdquo; he said,
      glancing with slight apprehensiveness at the other's face. He was a small,
      shy man, with few social attainments but an extraordinary amount of
      learning&mdash;the antithesis of the alert Blessington, whom he had
      replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder bore his scrutiny without flinching. Indeed, it struck him suddenly
      that there was a fund of interest, almost of excitement, in the
      encountering of each new pair of eyes. At the thought he moved forward to
      the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Greening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A very useful bit of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary glanced up, slightly puzzled. His endurance had been
      severely taxed in the fourteen days that he had filled his new post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you think so, sir,&rdquo; he said, hesitatingly. &ldquo;You rather
      pooh-poohed the matter this morning, if you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder was taking off his coat, but stopped in the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, did I? Did I?&rdquo; Then, struck by the
      opportunity the words gave him, he turned towards the secretary. &ldquo;You've
      got to get used to me, Greening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You haven't quite grasped me
      yet, I can see. I'm a man of moods, you know. Up to the present you've
      seen my slack side, my jarred side, but I have quite another when I care
      to show it. I'm a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde affair.&rdquo; Again he laughed, and
      Greening echoed the sound diffidently. Chilcote had evidently discouraged
      familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder eyed him with abrupt understanding. He recognized the loneliness in
      the anxious, conciliatory manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're tired,&rdquo; he said, kindly. &ldquo;Go to bed. I've got some thinking to do.
      Good-night.&rdquo; He held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greening took it, still half distrustful of this fresh side to so complex
      a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-morrow, if you approve, I shall go on with
      my notes. I hope you will have a restful night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a second Loder's eyebrows went up, but he recovered himself instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, thanks, Greening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thanks. I think your hope will be
      fulfilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched the little secretary move softly and apologetically to the
      door; then he walked to the fire, and, resting his elbows on the
      mantel-piece, he took his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space he stood absolutely quiet, then his hands dropped to his sides
      and he turned slowly round. In that short space he had balanced things and
      found his bearings. The slight nervousness shown in his brusque sentences
      and overconfident manner faded out, and he faced facts steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the return of his calmness he took a long survey of the room. His
      glance brightened appreciatively as it travelled from the walls lined with
      well-bound books to the lamps modulated to the proper light; from the
      lamps to the desk fitted with every requirement. Nothing was lacking. All
      he had once possessed, all he had since dreamed of, was here, but on a
      greater scale. To enjoy the luxuries of life a man must go long without
      them. Loder had lived severely&mdash;so severely that until three weeks
      ago he had believed himself exempt from the temptations of humanity. Then
      the voice of the world had spoken, and within him another voice had
      answered, with a tone so clamorous and insistent that it had outcried his
      surprised and incredulous wonder at its existence and its claims. That had
      been the voice of suppressed ambition; and now as he stood in the new
      atmosphere a newer voice lifted itself. The joy of material things rose
      suddenly, overbalancing the last remnant of the philosophy he had reared.
      He saw all things in a fresh light&mdash;the soft carpets, the soft
      lights, the numberless pleasant, unnecessary things that color the passing
      landscape and oil the wheels of life. This was power&mdash;power made
      manifest. The choice bindings of one's books, the quiet harmony of one's
      surroundings, the gratifying deference of one's dependants&mdash;these
      were the visible, the outward signs, the things he had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the room slowly, he lifted and looked at the different papers on
      the desk. They had a substantial feeling, an importance, an air of value.
      They were like the solemn keys to so many vexed problems. Beside the
      papers were a heap of letters neatly arranged and as yet unopened. He
      turned them over one by one. They were all thick, and interesting to look
      at. He smiled as he recalled his own scanty mail: envelopes long and bulky
      or narrow and thin&mdash;unwelcome manuscripts or very welcome checks.
      Having sorted the letters, he hesitated. It was his task to open them, but
      he had never in his life opened an envelope addressed to another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood uncertain, weighing them in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all at once a look of attention and surprise crossed his face, and he
      raised his head. Some one had unmistakably paused outside the door which
      Greening had left ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of apparent doubt, then a stir of skirts, a quick,
      uncertain knock, and the intruder entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a couple of seconds she stood in the doorway; then, as Loder made no
      effort to speak, she moved into the room. She had apparently but just
      returned from some entertainment, for, though she had drawn off her long
      gloves, she was still wearing an evening cloak of lace and fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she was Chilcote's wife Loder instinctively realized the moment she
      entered the room. But a disconcerting confusion of ideas was all that
      followed the knowledge. He stood by the desk, silent and awkward, trying
      to fit his expectations to his knowledge. Then, faced by the hopelessness
      of the task, he turned abruptly and looked at her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taken off her cloak and was standing by the fire. The compulsion
      of moving through life alone had set its seal upon her in a certain
      self-possession, a certain confidence of pose; yet her figure, as Loder
      then saw it, backgrounded by the dark books and gowned in pale blue, had a
      suggestion of youthfulness that seemed a contradiction. The remembrance of
      Chilcote's epithets &ldquo;cold&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsympathetic&rdquo; came back to him with
      something like astonishment. He felt no uncertainty, no dread of discovery
      and humiliation in her presence as he had felt in the maid's; yet there
      was something in her face that made him infinitely more uncomfortable. A
      look he could find no name for&mdash;a friendliness that studiously
      covered another feeling, whether question, distrust, or actual dislike he
      could not say. With a strange sensation of awkwardness he sorted
      Chilcote's letters, waiting for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if divining his thought, she turned towards him. &ldquo;I'm afraid I rather
      intrude,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you are busy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sense of courtesy was touched; he had begun life with a high opinion
      of women, and the words shook up an echo of the old sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think that,&rdquo; he said, hastily. &ldquo;I was only looking through&mdash;my
      letters. You mustn't rate yourself below letters.&rdquo; He was conscious that
      his tone was hurried, that his words were a little jagged; but Eve did not
      appear to notice. Unlike Greening, she took the new manner without
      surprise. She had known Chilcote for six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dined with the Fraides to-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Fraide sent you a
      message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously Loder smiled. There was humor in the thought of a message to
      him from the great Fraide. To hide his amusement he wheeled one of the big
      lounge-chairs forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were near together now, and he saw her face more fully. Again he was
      taken aback. Chilcote had spoken of her as successful and intelligent, but
      never as beautiful. Yet her beauty was a rare and uncommon fact. Her hair
      was black&mdash;not a glossy black, but the dusky black that is softer
      than any brown; her eyes were large and of a peculiarly pure blue; and her
      eyelashes were black, beautifully curved and of remarkable thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo; he said again, cutting short his thoughts with some
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She gravely accepted the proffered chair. But he saw that
      without any ostentation she drew her skirts aside as she passed him. The
      action displeased him unaccountably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, shortly, &ldquo;what had Fraide to say?&rdquo; He walked to the
      mantel-piece with his customary movement and stood watching her. The
      instinct towards hiding his face had left him. Her instant and
      uninterested acceptance of him almost nettled him; his own
      half-contemptuous impression of Chilcote came to him unpleasantly, and
      with it the first desire to assert his own individuality. Stung by the
      conflicting emotions, he felt in Chilcote's pockets for something to
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve saw and interpreted the action. &ldquo;Are these your cigarettes?&rdquo; She
      leaned towards a small table and took up a box made of lizard-skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; He took the box from her, and as it passed from one to the other
      he saw her glance at his rings. The glance was momentary; her lips parted
      to express question or surprise, then closed again without comment. More
      than any spoken words, the incident showed him the gulf that separated
      husband and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;what about Fraide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his words she sat straighter and looked at him more directly, as if
      bracing herself to a task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fraide is&mdash;is as interested as ever in you,&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in you?&rdquo; Loder made the interruption precisely as he felt Chilcote
      would have made it. Then instantly he wished the words back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve's warm skin colored more deeply; for a second the inscrutable
      underlying expression that puzzled him showed in her eyes, then she sank
      back into a corner of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you make such a point of sneering at my friends?&rdquo; she asked,
      quietly. &ldquo;I overlook it when you are nervous.&rdquo; She halted slightly on the
      word. &ldquo;But you are not nervous tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder, to his great humiliation, reddened. Except for an occasional
      outburst on the part of Mrs. Robins, his charwoman, he had not merited a
      woman's displeasure for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sneer was unintentional,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Eve showed a personal interest. She looked at him in a
      puzzled way. &ldquo;If your apology was meant,&rdquo; she said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;I
      should be glad to accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder, uncertain of how to take the words, moved back to the desk. He
      carried an unlighted cigarette between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval in which neither spoke. Then, at last, conscious of
      its awkwardness, Eve rose. With one hand on the back of her chair, she
      looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fraide thinks it's such a pity that&rdquo;&mdash;she stopped to choose her
      words&mdash;&ldquo;that you should lose hold on things&mdash;lose interest in
      things, as you are doing. He has been thinking a good deal about you in
      the last three weeks&mdash;ever since the day of your&mdash;your illness
      in the House; and it seems to him,&rdquo;&mdash;again she broke off, watching
      Loder's averted head&mdash;&ldquo;it seems to him that if you made one real
      effort now, even now, to shake off your restlessness, that your&mdash;your
      health might improve. He thinks that the present crisis would be&rdquo;&mdash;she
      hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;would give you a tremendous opportunity. Your trade
      interests, bound up as they are with Persia, would give any opinion you
      might hold a double weight.&rdquo; Almost unconsciously a touch of warmth crept
      into her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fraide talked very seriously about the beginning of your career. He
      said that if only the spirit of your first days could come back&mdash;&rdquo;
       Her tone grew quicker, as though she feared ridicule in Loder's silence.
      &ldquo;He asked me to use my influence. I know that I have little&mdash;none,
      perhaps&mdash;but I couldn't tell him that, and so&mdash;so I promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have kept the promise?&rdquo; Loder spoke at random. Her manner and her
      words had both affected him. There was a sensation of unreality in his
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I always want to do&mdash;what I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke a sudden realization of the effort she was making struck upon
      him, and with it his scorn of Chilcote rose in renewed force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intention&mdash;&rdquo; he began, turning to her. Then the futility of any
      declaration silenced him. &ldquo;I shall think over what you say,&rdquo; he added,
      after a minute's wait. &ldquo;I suppose I can't say more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met and she smiled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I expected as much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I'll go now. You
      have been wonderfully patient.&rdquo; Again she smiled slightly, at the same
      time extending her hand. The gesture was quite friendly, but in Loder's
      eyes it held relief as well as friendliness; and when their hands met he
      noticed that her fingers barely brushed his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up her cloak and carried it across the room. As he held the door
      open, he laid it quietly across her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll think over what you've said,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she glanced at him as if suspecting sarcasm then, partly reassured,
      she paused. &ldquo;You will always despise your opportunities, and I suppose I
      shall always envy them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That's the way with men and women.
      Good-night!&rdquo; With another faint smile she passed out into the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder waited until he heard the outer door close, then he crossed the room
      thoughtfully and dropped into the chair that she had vacated. He sat for a
      time looking at the hand her fingers had touched; then he lifted his head
      with a characteristic movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, aloud, &ldquo;how cordially she detests tests him!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Loder slept soundly and dreamlessly in Chilcote's canopied bed. To him the
      big room with its severe magnificence suggested nothing of the gloom and
      solitude that it held in its owner's eyes. The ponderous furniture, the
      high ceiling, the heavy curtains, unchanged since the days of Chilcote's
      grandfather, all hinted at a far-reaching ownership that stirred him. The
      ownership was mythical in his regard, and the possessions a mirage, but
      they filled the day. And, surely, sufficient for the day&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was his frame of mind as he opened his eyes on the following morning,
      and lay appreciative of his comfort, of the surrounding space, even of the
      light that filtered through the curtain chinks, suggestive of a world
      recreated. With day, all things seem possible to a healthy man. He
      stretched his arms luxuriously, delighting in the glossy smoothness of the
      sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it Chilcote had said? Better live for a day than exist for a
      lifetime! That was true; and life had begun. At thirty-six he was to know
      it for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, but without irony. Man is at his best at thirty-six, he mused.
      He has retained his enthusiasms and shed his exuberances; he has learned
      what to pick up and what to pass by; he no longer imagines that to drain a
      cup one must taste the dregs. He closed his eyes and stretched again, not
      his arms only, but his whole body. The pleasure of his mental state
      insisted on a physical expression. Then, sitting up in bed, he pressed the
      electric bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote's new valet responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull those curtains, Renwick!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What's the time?&rdquo; He had passed
      the ordeal of Renwick's eyes the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was slow, even a little stupid. He drew back the curtains
      carefully, then looked at the small clock on the dressing-table. &ldquo;Eight
      o'clock, sir. I didn't expect the bell so early, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder felt reproved, and a pause followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I bring your cup of tea, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not just yet. I'll have a bath first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renwick showed ponderous uncertainty. &ldquo;Warm, sir?&rdquo; he hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still perplexed, the man left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder smiled to himself. The chances of discovery in that quarter were not
      large. He was inclined to think that Chilcote had even overstepped
      necessity in the matter of his valet's dullness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He breakfasted alone, following Chilcote's habit, and after breakfast
      found his way to the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered, Greening rose with the same conciliatory haste that he had
      shown the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder nodded to him. &ldquo;Early at work?&rdquo; he said, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man showed instant, almost ridiculous relief. &ldquo;Good-morning,
      sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you too are early. I rather feared your nerves troubled
      you after I left last night, for I found your letters still unopened this
      morning. But I am glad to see you look so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder promptly turned his back to the light. &ldquo;Oh, last night's letters!&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Greening, my wife&rdquo;&mdash;his hesitation
      was very slight&mdash;&ldquo;my wife looked me up after you left, and we
      gossiped. I clean forgot the post.&rdquo; He smiled in an explanatory way as he
      moved to the desk and picked up the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Greening's eyes upon him, there was no time for scruples. With very
      creditable coolness he began opening the envelopes one by one. The letters
      were unimportant, and he passed them one after another to the secretary,
      experiencing a slight thrill of authority as each left his hand. Again the
      fact that power is visible in little things came to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me my engagement-book, Greening,&rdquo; he said, when the letters had been
      disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book that Greening handed him was neat in shape and bound, like
      Chilcote's cigarette-case, in lizard-skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Loder took it, the gold monogram &ldquo;J.C.&rdquo; winked at him in the bright
      morning light. The incident moved his sense of humor. He and the book were
      cooperators in the fraud, it seemed. He felt an inclination to wink back.
      Nevertheless, he opened it with proper gravity and skimmed the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page devoted to the day was almost full. On every other line were
      jottings in Chilcote's irregular hand, and twice among the entries
      appeared a prominent cross in blue pencilling. Loder's interest quickened
      as his eye caught the mark. It had been agreed between them that only
      engagements essential to Chilcote's public life need be carried through
      during his absence, and these, to save confusion, were to be crossed in
      blue pencil. The rest, for the most part social claims, were to be left to
      circumstance and Loder's inclination, Chilcote's erratic memory always
      accounting for the breaking of trivial promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder in his new energy was anxious for obligations; the desire for
      fresh and greater tests grew with indulgence. He scanned the two lines
      with eagerness. The first was an interview with Cresham, one of Chilcote's
      supporters in Wark; the other an engagement to lunch with Fraide. At the
      idea of the former his interest quickened, but at thought of the latter it
      quailed momentarily. Had the entry been a royal command it would have
      affected him infinitely less. For a space his assurance faltered; then, by
      coincidence, the recollection of Eve and Eve's words of last night came
      back to him, and his mind was filled with a new sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of Chilcote, he was despised by Chilcote's wife! There was no
      denying that in all the pleasant excitement of the adventure that
      knowledge had rankled. It came to him now linked with remembrance of the
      slight, reluctant touch of her fingers, the faintly evasive dislike
      underlying her glance. It was a trivial thing, but it touched his pride as
      a man. That was how he put it to himself. It wasn't that he valued this
      woman's opinion&mdash;any woman's opinion; it was merely that it touched
      his pride. He turned again to the window and gazed out, the engagement
      book still between his hands. What if he compelled her respect? What if by
      his own personality cloaked under Chilcote's identity he forced her to
      admit his capability? It was a matter of pride, after all&mdash;scarcely
      even of pride; self-respect was a better word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied by his own reasoning, he turned back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See to those letters, Greening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And for the rest of the
      morning's work you might go on with your Khorasan notes. I believe we'll
      all want every inch of knowledge we can get in that quarter before we're
      much older. I'll see you again later.&rdquo; With a reassuring nod he crossed
      the room and passed through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lunched with Fraide at his club, and afterwards walked with him to
      Westminster. The walk and lunch were both memorable. In that hour he
      learned many things that had been sealed to him before. He tasted his
      first draught of real elation, his first drop of real discomfiture. He saw
      for the first time how a great man may condescend&mdash;how
      unostentatiously, how fully, how delightfully. He felt what tact and
      kindness perfectly combined may accomplish, and he burned inwardly with a
      sense of duplicity that crushed and elated him alternately. He was John
      Loder, friendless, penniless, with no present and no future, yet he walked
      down Whitehall in the full light of day with one of the greatest statesmen
      England has known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some strangers were being shown over the Terrace when he and Fraide
      reached the House, and, noticing the open door, the old man paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never refuse fresh air,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall we take another breath of it
      before settling down?&rdquo; He took Loder's arm and drew him forward. As they
      passed through the door-way the pressure of his fingers tightened. &ldquo;I
      shall reckon to-day among my pleasantest memories, Chilcote,&rdquo; he said,
      gravely. &ldquo;I can't explain the feeling, but I seem to have touched Eve's
      husband&mdash;the real you, more closely this morning than I ever did
      before. It has been a genuine happiness.&rdquo; He looked up with the eyes that,
      through all his years of action and responsibility, had remained so
      bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder paled suddenly, and his glance turned to the river-wide,
      mysterious, secret. Unconsciously Fraide had stripped the illusion. It was
      not John Loder who walked here; it was Chilcote&mdash;Chilcote with his
      position, his constituency&mdash;his wife. He half extricated his arm, but
      Fraide held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don't draw away from me. You have always been too ready to
      do that. It is not often I have a pleasant truth to tell. I won't be
      deprived of the enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can the truth ever be pleasant, sir?&rdquo; Involuntarily Loder echoed
      Chilcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraide looked up. He was half a head shorter than his companion, though
      his dignity concealed the fact. &ldquo;Chilcote,&rdquo; he said, seriously, &ldquo;give up
      cynicism! It is the trade-mark of failure, and I do not like it in my
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder said nothing. The quiet insight of the reproof, its mitigating
      kindness, touched him sharply. In that moment he saw the rails down which
      he had sent his little car of existence spinning, and the sight daunted
      him. The track was steeper, the gauge narrower, than he had guessed; there
      were curves and sidings upon which he had not reckoned. He turned his head
      and met Fraide's glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't count too much on me, sir,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;I might disappoint
      you again.&rdquo; His voice broke off on the last word, for the sound of other
      voices and of laughter came to them across the Terrace as a group of two
      women and three men passed through the open door. At a glance he realized
      that the slighter of the two women was Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing them, she disengaged herself from her party and came quickly
      forward. He saw her cheeks flush and her eyes brighten pleasantly as they
      rested on his companion; but he noticed also that after her first cursory
      glance she avoided his own direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she came towards them, Fraide drew away his hand in readiness to greet
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes my godchild!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I often wish, Chilcote, that I could
      do away with the prefix.&rdquo; He added the last words in an undertone as he
      reached them; then he responded warmly to her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Turning the Terrace into the Garden of Eden in January!
      We cannot allow this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve laughed. &ldquo;Blame Lady Sarah!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We met at lunch, and she
      carried me off. Needless to say I hadn't to ask where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed, and Loder joined, a little uncertainly. He had yet to
      learn that the devotion of Fraide and his wife was a long-standing jest in
      their particular set.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his tardy laugh Eve turned to him. &ldquo;I hope I didn't rob
      you of all sleep last night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I caught him in his den,&rdquo; she
      explained, turning to Fraide, &ldquo;and invaded it most courageously. I believe
      we talked till two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder noticed bow quickly she looked from him to Fraide. The
      knowledge roused his self-assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an excellent night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do I look as if I hadn't slept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat slowly and reluctantly Eve looked back. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,
      truthfully, and with a faint surprise that to Loder seemed the first
      genuine emotion she had shown regarding him. &ldquo;No, I don't think I ever saw
      you look so well.&rdquo; She was quite unconscious and very charming as she made
      the admission. It struck Loder that her coloring of hair and eyes gained
      by daylight&mdash;were brightened and vivified by their setting of sombre
      river and sombre stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraide smiled at her affectionately; then looked at Loder. &ldquo;Chilcote has
      got anew lease of nerves, Eve,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;And I&mdash;believe&mdash;I
      have got a new henchman. But I see my wife beckoning to me. I must have a
      word with her before she flits away. May I be excused?&rdquo; He made a
      courteous gesture of apology; then smiled at Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked after him as he moved away. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder what I should
      do if anything were to happen to the Fraides,&rdquo; she said, a little
      wistfully. Then almost at once she laughed, as if regretting her
      impulsiveness. &ldquo;You heard what he said,&rdquo; she went on, in a different
      voice. &ldquo;Am I really to congratulate you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The change of tone stung Loder unaccountably. &ldquo;Will you always disbelieve
      in me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering, she walked slowly across the deserted Terrace and,
      pausing by the parapet, laid her hand on the stonework. Still in silence
      she looked out across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder had followed closely. Again her aloofness seemed a challenge. &ldquo;Will
      you always disbelieve in me?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she looked up at him, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever given me cause to believe!&rdquo; she asked, in a quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this truth he found no answer, though the subdued incredulity nettled
      him afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prompted to a further effort, he spoke again. &ldquo;Patience is necessary with
      every person and every circumstance,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We've all got to wait and
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not lower her gaze as he spoke; and there seemed to him something
      disconcerting in the clear, candid blue of her eyes. With a sudden dread
      of her next words, he moved forward and laid his hand beside hers on the
      parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience is needed for every one,&rdquo; he repeated, quickly. &ldquo;Sometimes a man
      is like a bit of wreckage; he drifts till some force stronger than himself
      gets in his way and stops him.&rdquo; He looked again at her face. He scarcely
      knew what he was saying; he only felt that he was a man in an egregiously
      false position, trying stupidly to justify himself. &ldquo;Don't you believe
      that flotsam can sometimes be washed ashore?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      High above them Big Ben chimed the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve raised her head. It almost seemed to him that he could see her answer
      trembling on her lips; then the voice of Lady Sarah Fraide came cheerfully
      from behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Eve! We must fly. It's absolutely three o'clock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0010" id="link2H_4_0010">

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      In the days that followed Fraide's marked adoption of him Loder behaved
      with a discretion that spoke well for his qualities. Many a man placed in
      the same responsible, and yet strangely irresponsible, position might have
      been excused if, for the time at least, he gave himself a loose rein. But
      Loder kept free of the temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all other experiments, his showed unlooked-for features when put to a
      working test. Its expected difficulties smoothed themselves away, while
      others, scarcely anticipated, came into prominence. Most notable of all,
      the physical likeness between himself and Chilcote, the bedrock of the
      whole scheme, which had been counted upon to offer most danger, worked
      without a hitch. He stood literally amazed before the sweeping credulity
      that met him on every hand. Men who had known Chilcote from his youth,
      servants who had been in his employment for years, joined issue in the
      unquestioning acceptance. At times the ease of the deception bewildered
      him; there were moments when he realized that, should circumstances force
      him to a declaration of the truth, he would not be believed. Human nature
      prefers its own eyesight to the testimony of any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in face of this astonishing success he steered a steady course. In the
      first exhilaration of Fraide's favor, in the first egotistical wish to
      break down Eve's scepticism, he might possibly have plunged into the
      vortex of action, let it be in what direction it might; but fortunately
      for himself, for Chilcote, and for their scheme, he was liable to
      strenuous second thoughts&mdash;those wise and necessary curbs that go
      further to the steadying of the universe than the universe guesses.
      Sitting in the quiet of the House, on the same day that he had spoken with
      Eve on the Terrace, he had weighed possibilities slowly and cautiously.
      Impressed to the full by the atmosphere of the place that in his eyes
      could never lack character, however dull its momentary business, however
      prosy the voice that filled it, he had sifted impulse from expedience, as
      only a man who has lived within himself can sift and distinguish. And at
      the close of that first day his programme bad been formed. There must be
      no rush, no headlong plunge, he had decided; things must work round. It
      was his first expedition into the new country, and it lay with fate to say
      whether it would be his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been leaning back in his seat, his eyes on the ministers opposite,
      his arms folded in imitation of Chilcote's most natural attitude, when
      this final speculation had come to him; and as it came his lips had
      tightened for a moment and his face become hard and cold. It is an
      unpleasant thing when a man first unconsciously reckons on the weakness of
      another, and the look that expresses the idea is not good to see. He had
      stirred uneasily; then his lips had closed again. He was tenacious by
      nature, and by nature intolerant of weakness. At the first suggestion of
      reckoning upon Chilcote's lapses, his mind had drawn back in disgust; but
      as the thought came again the disgust had lessened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a week&mdash;two weeks, perhaps&mdash;Chilcote would reclaim his place.
      Then would begin the routine of the affair. Chilcote, fresh from
      indulgence and freedom, would find his obligations a thousand times more
      irksome than before; he would struggle for a time; then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadowy smile had touched Loder's lips as the idea formed itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then would come the inevitable recall; then in earnest he might venture to
      put his hand to the plough. He never indulged in day-dreams, but something
      in the nature of a vision had flashed over his mind in that instant. He
      had seen himself standing in that same building, seen the rows of faces
      first bored, then hesitatingly transformed under his personal domination,
      under the one great power he knew himself to possess&mdash;the power of
      eloquence. The strength of the suggestion had been almost painful. Men who
      have attained self-repression are occasionally open to a perilous onrush
      of feeling. Believing that they know themselves, they walk boldly forward
      towards the high-road and the pitfall alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      These had been Loder's disconnected ideas and speculations on the first
      day of his new life. At four o'clock on the ninth day he was pacing with
      quiet confidence up and down Chilcote's study, his mind pleasantly busy
      and his cigar comfortably alight, when he paused in, his walk and frowned,
      interrupted by the entrance of a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man came softly into the room, drew a small table towards the fire,
      and proceeded to lay an extremely fine and unserviceable-looking cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder watched him in silence. He had grown to find silence a very useful
      commodity. To wait and let things develop was the attitude he oftenest
      assumed. But on this occasion he was perplexed. He had not rung for tea,
      and in any case a cup on a salver satisfied his wants. He looked
      critically at the fragile cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the servant departed, and solemnly reentered carrying a silver
      tray, with cups, a teapot, and cakes. Having adjusted them to his
      satisfaction, he turned to Loder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Chilcote will be with you in five minutes, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for some response, but Loder gave none. Again he had found the
      advantages of silence, but this time it was silence of a compulsory kind.
      He had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, finding him irresponsive, retired; and, left to himself, Loder
      stared at the array of feminine trifles; then, turning abruptly, he moved
      to the centre of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the day they had talked on the Terrace, he had only seen Eve thrice,
      and always in the presence e others. Since the night of his first coming,
      she has not invaded his domain, and he wondered what this new departure
      might mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thought of her had been less vivid in the last few days; for, though
      still using steady discretion, he had been drawn gradually nearer the
      fascinating whirlpool of new interests and new work. Shut his eyes as he
      might, there was no denying that this moment, so personally vital to him,
      was politically vital to the whole country; and that by a curious
      coincidence Chilcote's position well-nigh forced him to take an active
      interest in the situation. Again and again the suggestion had arisen that&mdash;should
      the smouldering fire in Persia break into a flame, Chilcote's commercial
      interests would facilitate, would practically compel, his standing in in
      the campaign against the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little incident of the tea-table, recalling the social side of his
      obligations, had aroused the realization of greater things. As he stood
      meditatively in the middle of the room he saw suddenly how absorbed he had
      become in these greater things. How, in the swing of congenial interests,
      he had been borne insensibly forward&mdash;his capacities expanding, his
      intelligence asserting itself. He had so undeniably found his sphere that
      the idea of usurpation had receded gently as by natural laws, until his
      own personality had begun to color the day's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this knowledge came, he wondered quickly if it held a solution of the
      present little comedy; if Eve had seen what others, he knew, had observed&mdash;that
      Chilcote was showing a grasp of things that he had not exhibited for
      years. Then, as a sound of skirts came softly down the corridor, he
      squared his shoulders with his habitual abrupt gesture and threw his cigar
      into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve entered the room much as she had done on her former visit, but with
      one difference. In passing Loder she quietly held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it as quietly. &ldquo;Why am I so honored?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little and looked across at the fire. &ldquo;How like a man! You
      always want to begin with reasons. Let's have tea first and explanations
      after.&rdquo; She moved forward towards the table, and he followed. As he did
      so, it struck him that her dress seemed in peculiar harmony with the day
      and the room, though beyond that he could not follow its details. As she
      paused beside the table he drew forward a chair with a faint touch of
      awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her in silence as she poured out the tea, and the thought
      crossed his mind that it was incredibly long since he had seen a woman
      preside over a meal. The deftness of her fingers filled him with an
      unfamiliar, half-inquisitive wonder. So interesting was the sensation
      that, when she held his cup towards him, he didn't immediately see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want any?&rdquo; She smiled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, embarrassed by his own tardiness. &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm dull,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I've been so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So keen a worker in the last week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he felt relieved. Then, as a fresh silence fell, his sense of
      awkwardness returned. He sipped his tea and ate a biscuit. He found
      himself wishing, for almost the first time, for some of the small society
      talk that came so pleasantly to other men. He felt that the position was
      ridiculous. He glanced at Eve's averted head, and laid his empty cup upon
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at once she turned, and their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you guess at all why I wanted to have tea with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, honestly and without embellishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtness of the answer might have displeased another woman. Eve seemed
      to take no offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a talk with the Fraides to-day,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;A long talk. Mr. Fraide
      said great things of you&mdash;things I wouldn't have believed from
      anybody but Mr. Fraide.&rdquo; She altered her position and looked from Loder's
      face back into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a step forward. &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; he said. He was almost ashamed of
      the sudden, inordinate satisfaction that welled up at her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I mustn't tell you!&rdquo; She laughed a little. &ldquo;But you have surprised
      him.&rdquo; She paused, sipped her tea, then looked up again with a change of
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, more seriously, &ldquo;there is one point that sticks a
      little. Will this great change last?&rdquo; Her voice was direct and even&mdash;wonderfully
      direct for a woman, Loder thought. It came to him with a certain force
      that beneath her remarkable charm might possibly lie a remarkable
      character. It was not a possibility that had occurred to him before, and
      it caused him to look at her a second time. In the new light he saw her
      beauty differently, and it interested him differently. Heretofore he had
      been inclined to class women under three heads&mdash;idols, amusements, or
      encumbrances; now it crossed his mind that a woman might possibly fill
      another place&mdash;the place of a companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very sceptical,&rdquo; he said, still looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not return his glance. &ldquo;I think I have been made sceptical,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke the image of Chilcote shot through his mind. Chilcote,
      irritable, vicious, unstable, and a quick compassion for this woman so
      inevitably shackled to him followed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve, unconscious of what was passing in his mind, went on with her
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were married,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;I had such a great interest in
      things, such a great belief in life. I had lived in politics, and I was
      marrying one of the coming men&mdash;everybody said you were one of the
      coming men&mdash;I scarcely felt there was anything left to ask for. You
      didn't make very ardent love,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;but I think I had forgotten
      about love. I wanted nothing so much as to be like Lady Sarah&mdash;married
      to a great man.&rdquo; She paused, then went on more hurriedly: &ldquo;For a while
      things went right; then slowly things, went wrong. You got your&mdash;your
      nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder changed his position with something of abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She misconstrued the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't think I want to be disagreeable,&rdquo; she said, hastily. &ldquo;I
      don't. I'm only trying to make you understand why&mdash;why I lost heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know,&rdquo; Loder's voice broke in involuntarily. &ldquo;Things got worse&mdash;then
      still worse. You found interference useless. At last you ceased to have a
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until a week ago.&rdquo; She glanced up quickly. Absorbed in her own feelings,
      she had seen nothing extraordinary in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at hers, Loder changed color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the most incredible thing in the world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's quite
      incredible, and yet I can't deny it. Against all my reason, all my
      experience, all my inclination I seem to feel in the last week something
      of what I felt at first.&rdquo; She stopped with an embarrassed laugh. &ldquo;It seems
      that, as if by magic, life has been picked up where I dropped it six years
      ago.&rdquo; Again she stopped and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder was keenly uncomfortable, but he could think of nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to begin that night I dined with the Fraides,&rdquo; she went on.
      &ldquo;Mr. Fraide talked so wisely and so kindly about many things. He recalled
      all we had hoped for in you; and&mdash;and he blamed me a little.&rdquo; She
      paused and laid her cup aside. &ldquo;He said that when people have made what
      they call their last effort, they should always make just one effort more.
      He promised that if I could once persuade you to take an interest in your
      work, he would do the rest. He said all that, and a thousand other kinder
      things&mdash;and I sat and listened. But all the time I thought of nothing
      but their uselessness. Before I left I promised to do my best&mdash;but my
      thought was still the same. It was stronger than ever when I forced myself
      to come up here&mdash;&rdquo; She paused again, and glanced at Loder's averted
      head. &ldquo;But I came, and then&mdash;as if by conquering myself I had
      compelled a reward, you seemed&mdash;you somehow seemed different. It
      sounds ridiculous, I know.&rdquo; Her voice was half amused, half deprecating.
      &ldquo;It wasn't a difference in your face, though I knew directly that you were
      free from&mdash;nerves.&rdquo; Again she hesitated over the word. &ldquo;It was a
      difference in yourself, in the things you said, more than in the way you
      said them.&rdquo; Once more she paused and laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder's discomfort grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it didn't affect me then.&rdquo; She spoke more slowly. &ldquo;I wouldn't admit
      it then. And the next day when we talked on the Terrace I still refused to
      admit it&mdash;though I felt it more strongly than before. But I have
      watched you since that day, and I know there is a change. Mr. Fraide feels
      the same, and he is never mistaken. I know it's only nine or ten days, but
      I've hardly seen you in the same mood for nine or ten hours in the last
      three years.&rdquo; She stopped, and the silence was expressive. It seemed to
      plead for confirmation of her instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Loder could find no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      After waiting for a moment, she leaned forward in her chair and looked up
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is it going to last? That's what I came to ask. I don't
      want to believe till I'm sure; I don't want to risk a new disappointment.&rdquo;
       Loder felt the earnestness of her gaze, though he avoided meeting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't have said this to you a week ago, but to-day I can. I don't
      pretend to explain why&mdash;the feeling is too inexplicable. I only know
      that I can say it now, and that I couldn't a week ago. Will you understand&mdash;and
      answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Loder remained mute. His position was horribly incongruous. What
      could he say? What dared he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused by his silence, Eve rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's only a phase, don't try to hide it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But if it's going
      to last&mdash;if by any possibility it's going to last&mdash;&rdquo; She
      hesitated and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite close to him. He would have been less than man had he been
      unconscious of the subtle contact of her glance, the nearness of her
      presence&mdash;and no one had ever hinted that manhood was lacking in him.
      It was a moment of temptation. His own energy, his own intentions, seemed
      so near; Chilcote and Chilcote's claims so distant and unreal. After all,
      his life, his ambitions, his determinations, were his own. He lifted his
      eyes and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to tell you that I will go on?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes brightened; she took a step forward. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want it
      more than anything in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a wait. The declaration that would satisfy her came to Loder's
      lips, but he delayed it. The delay, was fateful. While he stood silent the
      door opened and the servant who had brought in the tea reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the room and handed Loder a telegram. &ldquo;Any answer, sir?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve moved back to her chair. There was a flush on her cheeks and her eyes
      were still alertly bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder tore the telegram open, read it, then threw it Into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No answer!&rdquo; he said, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the brusqueness of his voice, Eve looked up. &ldquo;Disagreeable news?&rdquo; she
      said, as the servant departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn't look at her. He was watching the telegram withering in the
      centre of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at last, in a strained voice. &ldquo;No. Only news that I&mdash;that
      I had forgotten to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0011" id="link2H_4_0011">

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a silence&mdash;an uneasy break&mdash;after Loder spoke. The
      episode of the telegram was, to all appearances, ordinary enough, calling
      forth Eve's question and his own reply as a natural sequence; yet in the
      pause that followed it each was conscious of a jar, each was aware that in
      some subtle way the thread of sympathy had been dropped, though to one the
      cause was inexplicable and to the other only too plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder watched the ghost of his message grow whiter and thinner, then
      dissolve into airy fragments and flutter up the chimney. As the last
      morsel wavered out of sight, he turned and looked at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You almost made me commit myself,&rdquo; he said. In the desire to hide his
      feelings his tone was short.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve returned his glance with a quiet regard, but he scarcely saw it. He
      had a stupefied sense of disaster; a feeling of bitter self-commiseration
      that for the moment outweighed all other considerations. Almost at the
      moment of justification the good of life had crumbled in his fingers, the
      soil given beneath his feet, and with an absence of logic, a lack of
      justice unusual in him, he let resentment against Chilcote sweep suddenly
      over his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve, still watching him, saw the darkening of his expression, and with a
      quiet movement rose from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Sarah has a theatre-party to-night, and I am dining with her,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;It is an early dinner, so I must think about dressing. I'm sorry
      you think I tried to draw you into anything. I must have explained myself
      badly.&rdquo; She laughed a little, to cover the slight discomfiture that her
      tone betrayed, and as she laughed she moved across the room towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, engrossed in the check to his own schemes, incensed at the
      suddenness of Chilcote's recall, and still more incensed at his own folly
      in not having anticipated it, was oblivious for the moment of both her
      movement and her words. Then, quite abruptly, they obtruded themselves
      upon him, breaking through his egotism with something of the sharpness of
      pain following a blow. Turning quickly from the fireplace, he faced the
      shadowy room across which she had passed, but simultaneously with his
      turning she gained the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge that she was gone struck him with a sense of double loss.
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he called, suddenly moving forward. But almost at once he paused,
      chilled by the solitude of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; he said, using her name unconsciously for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the corridor, as well as the room, was empty; he was too late. He
      stood irresolute; then he laughed shortly, turned, and passed back towards
      the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow had fallen, the inevitable come to pass, and nothing remained but
      to take the fact with as good a grace as possible. Chilcote's telegram had
      summoned him to Clifford's Inn at seven o'clock, and it was now well on
      towards six. He pulled out his watch&mdash;Chilcote's watch he realized,
      with a touch of grim humor as he stooped to examine the dial by the light
      of the fire; then, as if the humor had verged to another feeling, he stood
      straight again and felt for the electric button in the wall. His fingers
      touched it, and simultaneously the room was lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abrupt alteration from shadow to light came almost as a shock. The
      feminine arrangement of the tea-table seemed incongruous beside the sober
      books and the desk laden with papers&mdash;incongruous as his own presence
      in the place. The thought was unpleasant, and he turned aside as if to
      avoid it; but at the movement his eyes fell on Chilcote's cigarette-box
      with its gleaming monogram, and the whimsical suggestion of his first
      morning rose again. The idea that the inanimate objects in the room knew
      him for what he was&mdash;recognized the interloper where human eyes saw
      the rightful possessor&mdash;returned to his mind. Through all his disgust
      and chagrin a smile forced itself to his lips, and, crossing the room for
      the second time, he passed into Chilcote's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the massive furniture and sombre atmosphere fitted better with his
      mood than the energy and action which the study always suggested. Walking
      directly to the great bed, he sat on its side and for several minutes
      stared straight in front of him, apparently seeing nothing; then at last
      the apathy passed from him, as his previous anger against Chilcote had
      passed. He stood up slowly, drawing his long limbs together, and recrossed
      the room, passing along the corridor and through the door communicating
      with the rest of the house. Five minutes later he was in the open air and
      walking steadily eastward, his hat drawn forward and his overcoat buttoned
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he traversed the streets he allowed himself no thought, Once, as he
      waited in Trafalgar Square to find a passage between the vehicles, the
      remembrance of Chilcote's voice coming out of the fog on their first night
      made itself prominent, but he rejected it quickly, guarding himself from
      even an involuntary glance at the place of their meeting. The Strand, with
      its unceasing life, came to him as something almost unfamiliar. Since his
      identification with the new life no business had drawn him east of Charing
      Cross, and his first sight of the narrower stream of traffic struck him as
      garish and unpleasant. As the impression came he accelerated his steps,
      moved by the wish to make regret and retrospection alike impossible by a
      contact with actual forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still walking hastily, he entered Clifford's Inn, but there almost
      unconsciously his feet halted. There was something in the quiet
      immutability of the place that sobered energy, both mental and physical. A
      sense of changelessness&mdash;the changelessness of inanimate things, that
      rises in such solemn contrast to the variableness of mere human nature,
      which a new environment, a new outlook, sometimes even a new presence, has
      power to upheave and remould. He paused; then with slower and steadier
      steps crossed the little court and mounted the familiar stairs of his own
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned the handle of his own door some one stirred inside the
      sitting-room. Still under the influence of the stones and trees that he
      had just left, he moved directly towards the sound, and, without waiting
      for permission, entered the room. After the darkness of the passage it
      seemed well alight, for, besides the lamp with its green shade, a large
      fire burned in the grate and helped to dispel the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the room Chilcote rose and came forward, his figure thrown
      into strong relief by the double light. He was dressed in a shabby tweed
      suit; his face looked pale and set with a slightly nervous tension, but
      besides the look and a certain added restlessness of glance there was no
      visible change. Reaching Loder, he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked at him questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Well? How has it gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scheme? Oh, excellently!&rdquo; Loder's manner was abrupt. Turning from the
      restless curiosity in Chilcote's eyes, he moved a little way across the
      room and began to draw off his coat. Then, as if struck by the incivility
      of the action, he looked back again. &ldquo;The scheme has gone
      extraordinarily,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I could almost say absurdly. There are some
      things, Chilcote, that fairly bowl a man over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great relief tinged Chilcote's face. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Tell me all
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Loder was reticent. The moment was not propitious. It was as if a
      hungry man had dreamed a great banquet and had awakened to his starvation.
      He was chary of imparting his visions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to tell,&rdquo; he said, shortly. &ldquo;All that you'll want to know
      is here in black and white. I don't think you'll find I have slipped
      anything; it's a clear business record.&rdquo; From an inner pocket he drew out
      a bulky note-book, and, recrossing the room, laid it open on the table. It
      was a correct, even a minute, record of every action that had been
      accomplished in Chilcote's name. &ldquo;I don't think you'll find any loose
      ends,&rdquo; he said, as he turned back the pages. &ldquo;I had you and your position
      in my mind all through.&rdquo; He paused and glanced up from the book. &ldquo;You have
      a position that absolutely insists upon attention,&rdquo; he added, in a
      different voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the new tone Chilcote looked up as well. &ldquo;No moral lectures!&rdquo; he said,
      with a nervous laugh. &ldquo;I was anxious to know if you had pulled it off&mdash;and
      you have reassured me. That's enough. I was in a funk this afternoon to
      know how things were going-one of those sudden, unreasonable funks. But
      now that I see you&rdquo;&mdash;he cut himself short and laughed once more &ldquo;now
      that I see you, I'm hanged if I don't want to&mdash;to prolong your
      engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder glanced at him, then glanced away. He felt a quick shame at the
      eagerness that rose at the words&mdash;a surprised contempt at his own
      readiness to anticipate the man's weakness. But almost as speedily as he
      had turned away he looked back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, man!&rdquo; he said, with his old, intolerant manner. &ldquo;You're dreaming.
      You've had your holiday and school's begun again. You must remember you
      are dining with the Charringtons to-night. Young Charrington's coming of
      age&mdash;quite a big business. Come along! I want my clothes.&rdquo; He
      laughed, and, moving closer to Chilcote, slapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote started; then, suddenly becoming imbued with the other's manner,
      he echoed the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're right! You're quite right! A man must keep his
      feet in their own groove.&rdquo; Raising his hand, he began to fumble with his
      tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder kept the same position. &ldquo;You'll find the check-book in its usual
      drawer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've made one entry of a hundred pounds&mdash;pay for
      the first week. The rest can stand over until&mdash;&rdquo; He paused abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote shifted his position. &ldquo;Don't talk about that. It upsets me to
      anticipate. I can make out a check to-morrow payable to John Loder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That can wait. The name of Loder is better out of the book. We can't
      be too careful.&rdquo; Loder spoke with unusual impetuosity. Already a slight,
      unreasonable jealousy was coloring his thoughts. Already he grudged the
      idea of Chilcote with his unstable glance and restless fingers opening the
      drawers and sorting the papers that for one stupendous fortnight had been
      his without question. Turning aside, he changed the subject brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the bedroom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's half-past seven if it's a minute,
      and the Charringtons' show is at nine.&rdquo; Without waiting for a reply, he
      walked across the room and held the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no silence while they exchanged clothes. Loder talked
      continuously, sometimes in short, curt sentences, sometimes with ironic
      touches of humor; he talked until Chilcote, strangely affected by contact
      with another personality after his weeks of solitude, fell under his
      influence&mdash;his excitement rising, his imagination stirring at the
      novelty of change. At last, garbed once more in the clothes of his own
      world, he passed from the bedroom back into the sitting-room, and there
      halted, waiting for his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost directly Loder followed. He came into the room quietly, and, moving
      at once to the table, picked up the note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to preach,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;so you needn't shut me up. But I'll
      say just one thing&mdash;a thing that will get said. Try and keep your
      hold! Remember your responsibilities&mdash;and keep your hold!&rdquo; He spoke
      energetically, looking earnestly into Chilcote's eyes. He did not realize
      it, but he was pleading for his own career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote paled a little, as he always did in face of a reality. Then he
      extended his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, with a touch of hauteur, &ldquo;a man can generally
      be trusted to look after his own life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Extricating his hand almost immediately, he turned towards the door and
      without a word of farewell passed into the little hall, leaving Loder
      alone in the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the night of Chilcote's return to his own, Loder tasted the lees of
      life poignantly for the first time. Before their curious compact had been
      entered upon he had been, if not content, at least apathetic; but with
      action the apathy had been dispersed, never again to regain its old
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized with bitter certainty that his was no real home-coming. On
      entering Chilcote's house he had experienced none of the unfamiliarity,
      none of the unsettled awkwardness, that assailed him now. There he had
      almost seemed the exile returning after many hardships; here, in the
      atmosphere made common by years, he felt an alien. It was illustrative of
      the man's character that sentimentalities found no place in his nature.
      Sentiments were not lacking, though they lay out of sight, but
      sentimentalities he altogether denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone in the sitting-room after Chilcote's departure, his first
      sensation was one of physical discomfort and unfamiliarity. His own
      clothes, with their worn looseness, brought no sense of friendliness such
      as some men find in an old garment. Lounging, and the clothes that
      suggested lounging, had no appeal for him. In his eyes the garb that
      implies responsibility was symbolic and even inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as with clothes, so with his actual surroundings. Each detail of his
      room was familiar, but not one had ever become intimately close. He had
      used the place for years, but he had used it as he might use a hotel; and
      whatever of his household gods had come with him remained, like himself,
      on sufferance. His entrance into Chilcote's surroundings had been
      altogether different. Unknown to himself, he had been in the position of a
      young artist who, having roughly modelled in clay, is brought into the
      studio of a sculptor. To his outward vision everything is new, but his
      inner sight leaps to instant understanding. Amid all the strangeness he
      recognizes the one essential&mdash;the workshop, the atmosphere, the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this first night of return Loder comprehended something of his
      position; and, comprehending, he faced the problem and fought with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made his bargain and must pay his share. Weighing this, he had
      looked about his room with a quiet gaze. Then at last, as if finding the
      object really sought for, his eyes had come round to the mantel-piece and
      rested on the pipe-rack. The pipes stood precisely as he had left them. He
      had looked at them for a long time, then an ironic expression that was
      almost a smile had touched his lips, and, crossing the room, he had taken
      the oldest and blackest from its place and slowly filled it with tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first indrawn breath of smoke his attitude had unbent. Without
      conscious determination, he had chosen the one factor capable of easing
      his mood. A cigarette is for the trivial moments of life; a cigar for its
      fulfilments, its pleasant, comfortable retrospections; but in real
      distress&mdash;in the solving of question, the fighting of difficulty&mdash;a
      pipe is man's eternal solace,
    </p>
    <p>
      So he had passed the first night of his return to the actualities of life.
      Next day his mind was somewhat settled and outward aid was not so
      essential; but though facts faced him more solidly, they were nevertheless
      very drab in shade. The necessity for work, that blessed antidote to
      ennui, no longer forced him to endeavor. He was no longer penniless; but
      the money, he possessed brought with it no desires. When a man has lived
      from hand to mouth for years, and suddenly finds himself with a hundred
      pounds in his pocket, the result is sometimes curious. He finds with a
      vague sense of surprise that he has forgotten how to spend. That
      extravagance, like other artificial passions, requires cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This he realized even more fully on the days that followed the night of
      his first return; and with it was born a new bitterness. The man who has
      friends and no money may find life difficult; but the man who has money
      and no friend to rejoice in his fortune or benefit by his generosity is
      aloof indeed. With the leaven of incredulity that works in all strong
      natures, Loder distrusted the professional beggar&mdash;therefore the
      charity that bestows easily and promiscuously was denied him; and of other
      channels of generosity he was too self-contained to have learned the
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      When depression falls upon a man of usually even temperament it descends
      with a double weight. The mercurial nature has a hundred counterbalancing
      devices to rid itself of gloom&mdash;a sudden lifting of spirit, a memory
      of other moods lived through, other blacknesses dispersed by time; but the
      man of level nature has none of these. Depression, when it comes, is
      indeed depression; no phase of mind to be superseded by another phase, but
      a slackening of all the chords of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was through such a depression as this that he labored during three
      weeks, while no summons and no hint of remembrance came from Chilcote. His
      position was peculiarly difficult. He found no action in the present, and
      towards the future he dared not trust himself to look. He had slipped the
      old moorings that familiarity had rendered endurable; but having slipped
      them, he had found no substitute. Such was his case on the last night of
      the three weeks, and such his frame of mind as he crossed Fleet Street
      from Clifford's Inn to Middle Temple Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was scarcely seven o'clock, but already the dusk was falling; the
      greater press of vehicles had ceased, and the light of the street lamps
      gleamed back from the spaces of dry and polished roadway, worn smooth as a
      mirror by wheels and hoofs. Something of the solitude of night that sits
      so ill on the strenuous city street was making itself felt, though the
      throngs of people on the pathway still streamed eastward and westward and
      the taverns made a busy trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having crossed the roadway, Loder paused for a moment to survey the scene.
      But humanity in the abstract made small appeal to him, and his glance
      wandered from the passers-by to the buildings massed like clouds against
      the dark sky. As his gaze moved slowly from one to the other a clock near
      at hand struck seven, and an instant later the chorus was taken up by a
      dozen clamorous tongues. Usually he scarcely heard, and never heeded,
      these innumerable chimes; but this evening their effect was strange.
      Coming out of the darkness, they seemed to possess a personal note, a
      human declaration. The impression was fantastic, but it was strong; with a
      species of revolt against life and his own personality, he turned slowly
      and moved forward in the direction of Ludgate Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space he continued his course, then, reaching Bouverie Street, he
      turned sharply to the right and made his way down the slight incline that
      leads to the Embankment. There he paused and drew a long breath. The sense
      of space and darkness soothed him. Pulling his cap over his eyes, he
      crossed to the river and walked on in the direction of Westminster Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked the great mass, of water by his side looked dense and smooth
      as oil with its sweeping width and network of reflected light. On its
      farther bank rose the tall buildings, the chimneys, the flaring lights
      that suggest another and an alien London; close at hand stretched the
      solid stone parapet, giving assurance of protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things he saw with his mental eyes, but with his mental eyes
      only, for his physical gaze was fixed ahead where the Houses of Parliament
      loomed out of the dusk. From the great building his eyes never wavered
      until the Embankment was traversed and Westminster Bridge reached. Then he
      paused, resting his arms on the coping of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tense quietude of the darkness the place looked vast and inspiring.
      The shadowy Terrace, the silent river, the rows of lighted windows, each
      was significant. Slowly and comprehensively his glance passed from one to
      the other. He was no sentimentalist and no dreamer; his act was simply the
      act of a man whose interests, robbed of their natural outlet, turn
      instinctively towards the forms and symbols of the work that is denied
      them. His scrutiny was steady&mdash;even cold. He was raised to no
      exaltation by the vastness of the building, nor was he chilled by any
      dwarfing of himself. He looked at it long and thoughtfully; then, again
      moving slowly, he turned and retraced his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was full as he walked back, still oblivious of the stone parapet
      of the Embankment, the bare trees, and the flaring lights of the
      advertisements across the water. Turning to the left, he regained Fleet
      Street and made for his own habitation with the quiet accuracy that some
      men exhibit in moments of absorption.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed Clifford's Inn with the same slow, almost listless step; then,
      as his own doorway came into view, he stopped. Some one was standing in
      its recess.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he wondered if his fancy were playing him a trick; then his
      reason sprang to certainty with so fierce a leap that for an instant his
      mind recoiled. For we more often stand aghast at the strength of our own
      feelings than before the enormity of our neighbor's actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Chilcote?&rdquo; he said, below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his voice the other wheeled round. &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      thought you were the ghost of some old inhabitant. I suppose I am very
      unexpected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder took the hand that he extended and pressed the fingers
      unconsciously. The sight of this man was like the finding of an oasis at
      the point where the desert is sandiest, deadliest, most unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are&mdash;unexpected,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote looked at him, then looked out into the court. &ldquo;I'm done up,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I'm right at the end of the tether.&rdquo; He laughed as he said it, but
      in the dim light of the hall Loder thought his face looked ill and
      harassed despite the flush that the excitement of the meeting had brought
      to it. Taking his arm, he drew him towards the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the rope has run out, eh?&rdquo; he said, in imitation of the other's tone.
      But under the quiet of his manner his own nerves were throbbing with the
      peculiar alertness of anticipation; a sudden sense of mastery over life,
      that lifted him above surroundings and above persons&mdash;a sense of
      stature, mental and physical, from which he surveyed the world. He felt as
      if fate, in the moment of utter darkness, had given him a sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the hall, Chilcote had drawn away and was already mounting
      the stairs. And as Loder followed, it came sharply to his mind that here,
      in the slipshod freedom of a door that was always open and stairs that
      were innocent of covering, lay his companion's real niche&mdash;unrecognized
      in outward avowal, but acknowledged by the inward, keener sense that
      manifests the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence they mounted the stairs, but on the first landing Chilcote
      paused and looked back, surveying Loder from the superior height of two
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did very well at first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did very well&mdash;I almost
      followed your example, for a week or so. I found myself on a sort of
      pinnacle&mdash;and I clung on. But in the last ten days I've&mdash;I've
      rather lapsed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Loder avoided looking at his face; he kept his eyes fixed
      determinately on the spot where his own hand gripped the banister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Chilcote repeated. &ldquo;Oh, the prehistoric tale&mdash;weakness
      stronger than strength. I'm-I'm sorry to come down on you like this, but
      it's the social side that bowls me over. It's the social side I can't
      stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The social side? But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think. I never think; it entails such a constant upsetting of
      principles and theories. We did arrange for business only, but one can't
      set up barriers. Society pushes itself everywhere nowadays&mdash;into
      business most of all. I don't want you for theatre-parties or dinners. But
      a big reception with a political flavor is different. A man has to be seen
      at these things; he needn't say anything or do anything, but it's bad form
      if he fails to show up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder raised his head. &ldquo;You must explain,&rdquo; he said, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote started slightly at the sudden demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose I'm rather irrelevant,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;Fact is,
      there's a reception at the Bramfells' to-night. You know Blanche Bramfell&mdash;Viscountess
      Bramfell, sister to Lillian Astrupp.&rdquo; His words conveyed nothing to Loder,
      but he did not consider that. All explanations were irksome to him and he
      invariably chafed to be done with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you've got to put in an appearance&mdash;for party reasons?&rdquo; Loder
      broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote showed relief. &ldquo;Yes. Old Fraide makes rather a point of it&mdash;so
      does Eve.&rdquo; He said the last words carelessly; then, as if their sound
      recalled something, his expression changed. A touch of satirical amusement
      touched his lips and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-way, Loder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my wife was actually tolerant of me for
      nine or ten days after my return. I thought your representation was to be
      quite impersonal? I'm not jealous,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I'm not jealous, I assure
      you; but the burned child shouldn't grow absentminded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his tone and his laugh Loder's blood stirred; with a sudden, unexpected
      impulse his hand tightened on the banister, and, looking up, he caught
      sight of the face above him&mdash;his own face, it seemed, alight with
      malicious interest. At the sight a strange sensation seized him; his grip
      on the banister loosened, and, pushing past Chilcote, he hurriedly mounted
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside his own door the other overtook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loder!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Loder! I meant no harm. A man must have a laugh
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Loder was facing the door and did not turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden fear shook Chilcote. &ldquo;Loder!&rdquo; he exclaimed again, &ldquo;you wouldn't
      desert me? I can't go back to-night. I can't go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Loder remained immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed by his silence, Chilcote stepped closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loder! Loder, you won't desert me?&rdquo; He caught hastily at his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick repulsion Loder shook him off; then almost as quickly he
      turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fools we all are!&rdquo; he said, abruptly. &ldquo;We, only differ in degree.
      Come in, and let us change our clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The best moments of a man's life are the moments when, strong in himself,
      he feels that the world lies before him. Gratified ambition may be the
      summer, but anticipation is the ardent spring-time of a man's career.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Loder drove that night frown Fleet Street to Grosvenor Square he
      realized this&mdash;though scarcely with any degree of consciousness&mdash;for
      he was no accomplished self-analyst. But in a wave of feeling too vigorous
      to be denied he recognized his regained foothold&mdash;the step that
      lifted him at once from the pit to the pinnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment of realization he looked neither backward nor forward. The
      present was all-sufficing. Difficulties might loom ahead, but difficulties
      had but one object&mdash;the testing and sharpening of a man's strength.
      In the first deep surge of egotistical feeling he almost rejoiced in
      Chilcote's weakness. The more Chilcote tangled the threads of his life,
      the stronger must be the fingers that unravelled them. He was possessed by
      a great impatience; the joy of action was stirring in his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the cab, he walked confidently to the door of Chilcote's house and
      inserted the latch-key. Even in this small act there was a grain of
      individual satisfaction. Then very quietly he opened the door and crossed
      the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered, a footman was arranging the fire that burned in the big
      grate. Seeing the man, he halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your mistress?&rdquo; he asked, in unconscious repetition of his first
      question in the same house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up. &ldquo;She has just finished dinner, sir. She dined alone in
      her own room.&rdquo; He glanced at Loder in the quick, uncertain way that was
      noticeable in all the servants of the household when they addressed their
      master. Loder saw the look and wondered what depth of curiosity it
      betrayed, how much of insight into the domestic life that he must always
      be content to skim. For an instant the old resentment against Chilcote
      tinged his exaltation, but he swept it angrily aside. Without further
      remark he began to mount the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaining the landing, he did not turn as usual to the door that shut off
      Chilcote's rooms, but moved onward down the corridor towards Eve's private
      sitting-room. He moved slowly till the door was reached; then he, paused
      and lifted his hand. There was a moment's wait while his fingers rested on
      the handle; then a sensation he could not explain&mdash;a reticence, a
      reluctance to intrude upon this one precinct&mdash;caused his, fingers to
      relax. With a slightly embarrassed gesture he drew back slowly and
      retraced his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in Chilcote's bedroom, he walked to the nearest bell and pressed it.
      Renwick responded, and at sight of him Loder's feelings warmed with the
      same sense of fitness and familiarity that the great bed and sombre
      furniture of the room had inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man did not come forward as he had expected. He remained close to
      the door with a hesitation that was unusual in a trained servant. It
      struck Loder that possibly his stolidity had exasperated Chilcote, and
      that possibly Chilcote had been at no pains to conceal the exasperation.
      The idea caused him to smile involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the room, Renwick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's uncomfortable to see you
      standing there. I want to know if Mrs. Chilcote has sent me any message
      about to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renwick studied him furtively as he came forward. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Chilcote's maid said that the carriage was ordered for ten-fifteen,
      and she hoped that would suit you.&rdquo; He spoke reluctantly, as if expecting
      a rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the opening sentence Loder had turned aside, but now, as the man
      finished, he wheeled round again and looked at him closely with his keen,
      observant eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can't have you speak to me like that. I may come
      down on you rather sharply when my&mdash;my nerves are bad; but when I'm
      myself I treat you&mdash;well, I treat you decently, at any rate. You'll
      have to learn to discriminate. Look at me now!&rdquo; A thrill of risk and of
      rulership passed through him as he spoke. &ldquo;Look at me now! Do I look as I
      looked this morning&mdash;or yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man eyed him half stupidly, half timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Loder insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; Renwick responded, with some slowness; &ldquo;you look the same&mdash;and
      you look different. A healthier color, perhaps, sir&mdash;and the eye
      clearer.&rdquo; He grew more confident under Loder's half-humorous,
      half-insistent gaze. &ldquo;Now that I look closer, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed. &ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now that you look closer. You'll
      have to grow observant: observation is an excellent quality in a servant.
      Wheat you come into a room in future, look first of all at me&mdash;and
      take your cue from that. Remember that serving a man with nerves is like
      serving two masters. Now you can go; and tell Mrs. Chilcote's maid that I
      shall be quite ready at a quarter-past ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. And after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing further. I sha'n't want you again to-night.&rdquo; He turned away as he
      spoke, and moved towards the great fire that was always kept alight in
      Chilcote's room. But as the man moved towards the door he wheeled back
      again. &ldquo;Oh, one thing more, Renwick! Bring me some sandwiches and a
      whiskey.&rdquo; He remembered for the first time that he had eaten nothing since
      early afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a few minutes after ten Loder left Chilcote's room, resolutely
      descended the stairs, and took up his position in the hall. Resolution is
      a strong word to apply to such a proceeding, but something in his bearing,
      in the attitude of his shoulders and head, instinctively suggested it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five or six minutes passed, but he waited without impatience; then at last
      the sound of a carriage stopping before the house caused him to lift his
      head, and at the same instant Eve appeared at the head of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there for a second, looking down on him, her maid a pace or two
      behind, holding her cloak. The picture she made struck upon his mind with
      something of a revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his first sight of her she had appealed to him as a strange blending of
      youth and self-possession&mdash;a girl with a woman's clearer perception
      of life; later he had been drawn to study her in other aspects&mdash;as a
      possible comrade and friend; now for the first time he saw her as a power
      in her own world, a woman to whom no man could deny consideration. She
      looked taller for the distance between them, and the distinction of her
      carriage added to the effect. Her black gown was exquisitely soft&mdash;as
      soft as her black hair; above her forehead was a cluster of splendid
      diamonds shaped like a coronet, and a band of the same stones encircled
      her neck. Loder realized in a glance that only the most distinguished of
      women could wear such ornaments and not have her beauty eclipsed. With a
      touch of the old awkwardness that had before assailed him in her presence,
      he came slowly forward as she descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help you with your cloak?&rdquo; he asked. And as he asked it, something
      like surprise at his own timidity crossed his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second Eve's glance rested on his face. Her expression was quite
      impassive, but as she lowered her lashes a faint gleam flickered across
      her eyes; nevertheless, her answer, when it came, was studiously
      courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but Marie will do all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked at her for a moment, then turned aside. He was not hurt by
      his rebuff; rather, by an interesting sequence of impressions, he was
      stirred by it. The pride that had refused Chilcote's help, and the
      self-control that had refused it graciously, moved him to admiration. He
      understood and appreciated both by the light of person experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is waiting, sir,&rdquo; Crapham's voice broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder nodded, and Eve turned to her maid. &ldquo;That will do, Marie,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I shall want a cup of chocolate when I get back&mdash;probably at one o
      clock.&rdquo; She drew her cloak about her shoulders and moved towards the door.
      Then she paused and looked back. &ldquo;Shall we start?&rdquo; she asked, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, still watching her, came forward at once. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said,
      with unusual gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her as she crossed the footpath, but made no further offer of
      help; and when the moment came he quietly took his place beside her in the
      carriage. His last impression, as the horses wheeled round, was of the
      open hall door&mdash;Crapham in his sombre livery and the maid in her
      black dress, both silhouetted against the dark background of the hall;
      then, as the carriage moved forward smoothly and rapidly, he leaned back
      in his seat and closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first few moments of the drive there was silence. To Loder
      there was a strange, new sensation in this companionship, so close and yet
      so distant. He was so near to Eve that the slight fragrant scent from her
      clothes might almost have belonged to his own. The impression was
      confusing yet vaguely delightful. It was years since he had been so close
      to a woman of his own class&mdash;his own caste. He acknowledged the
      thought with a curious sense of pleasure. Involuntarily he turned and
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting very straight, her fine profile cut clear against the
      carriage window, her diamonds quivering in the light that flashed by them
      from the street. For a space the sense of unreality that had pervaded his
      first entrance into Chilcote's life touched him again, then another and
      more potent feeling rose to quell it. Almost involuntarily as he looked at
      her his lips parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I say something?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve remained motionless. She did not turn her head, as most women would
      have done. &ldquo;Say anything you like,&rdquo; she said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything?&rdquo; He bent a little nearer, filled again by the inordinate wish
      to dominate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that her voice sounded forced and a little tired. For a
      moment he looked through the window at the passing lights; then slowly his
      gaze returned to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look very beautiful to-night,&rdquo; he said. His voice was low and his
      manner unemotional, but his words had the effect he desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head, and her eyes met his in a glance of curiosity and
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slight as the triumph was, it thrilled him. The small scene with
      Chilcote's valet came back to him; his own personality moved him again to
      a reckless determination to make his own voice heard. Leaning forward, he
      laid his hand lightly on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, quickly&mdash;&ldquo;Eve, do you remember?&rdquo; Then he paused and
      withdrew his hand. The horses had slackened speed, then stopped altogether
      as the carriage fell into line outside Bramfell House.

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Loder entered Lady Bramfell's feeling far more like an actor in a drama
      than an ordinary man in a peculiar situation. It was the first time he had
      played Chilcote to a purely social audience, and the first time for many
      years that he had rubbed shoulders with a well-dressed crowd ostensibly
      brought together for amusement. As he followed Eve along the corridor that
      led to the reception-rooms he questioned the reality of the position again
      and again; then abruptly, at the moment when the sensation of
      unfamiliarity was strongest, a cheery voice hailed him, and, turning, he
      saw the square shoulders, light eyes, and pointed mustache of Lakeley, the
      owner of the 'St. George's Gazette'.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of the man and the sound of his greeting his doubts and
      speculations vanished. The essentials of life rose again to the position
      they had occupied three weeks ago, in the short but strenuous period when
      his dormant activities had been stirred and he had recognized his true
      self. He lifted his head unconsciously, the shade of misgiving that had
      crossed his confidence passing from him as he smiled at Lakeley with a
      keen, alert pleasure that altered his whole face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve, looking back, saw the expression. It attracted and held her, like a
      sudden glimpse into a secret room. In all the years of her marriage, in
      the months of her courtship even, she had never surprised the look on
      Chilcote's face. The impression came quickly, and with it a strange, warm
      rush of interest that receded slowly, leaving an odd sense of loneliness.
      But, at the moment that the feeling came and passed, her attention was
      claimed in another direction. A slight, fair-haired boy forced his way
      towards her through the press of people that filled the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Chilcote!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Can I believe my luck in finding you
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve laughed. It seemed that there was relief in her laugh. &ldquo;How absurd you
      are, Bobby!&rdquo; she said, kindly. &ldquo;But you are wrong. My husband is here&mdash;I
      am waiting for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington looked round. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Then he relapsed into
      silence. He was the soul of good-nature, but those who knew him best knew
      that Chilcote's summary change of secretaries had rankled. Eve, conscious
      of the little jar, made haste to smooth it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about yourself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington looked at her, then smiled again, his buoyancy restored.
      &ldquo;Doing?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, calling every other afternoon at Grosvenor Square&mdash;only
      to find that a certain lady is never at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his tone Eve laughed again. The boy, with his frank and ingenuous
      nature, had beguiled many a dull hour for her in past days, and she had
      missed him not a little when his place had been filled by Greening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean seriously, Bobby. Has something good turned up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington made a wry face &ldquo;Something is on its way&mdash;that's why I am
      on duty to-right. Old Bramfell and the pater are working it between them.
      So if Lady Bramfell or Lady Astrupp happen to drop a fan or a handkerchief
      this evening, I've got to be here to pick it up. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you picked up my fans and handkerchiefs last year&mdash;and the year
      before?&rdquo; Eve smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blessington's face suddenly looked grave. &ldquo;I wish you hadn't said that,&rdquo;
       he said. Then he paused abruptly. Out of the hum of talk behind them a
      man's laugh sounded. It was not loud, but it was a laugh that one seldom
      hears in a London drawing-room&mdash;it expressed interest, amusement, and
      in an inexplicable may it seemed also to express strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve and Blessington both turned involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Blessington
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder was parting with Lakely, and his was the laugh that had attracted
      them both. The interest excited by his talk was still reflected in his
      face and bearing as he made his way towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Blessington again. &ldquo;I never realized that Chilcote was so
      tall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Eve said nothing. But silently and with a more subtle meaning she
      found herself echoing the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until he was quite close to her, Loder did not seem to see her. Then he
      stopped quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was speaking to Lakely,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He wants me to dine with him one
      night at Cadogan Gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Eve was silent, waiting for him to address Blessington. She glanced at
      him quickly, but though their eyes met he did not catch the meaning that
      lay in hers. It was a difficult moment. She had known him incredibly,
      almost unpardonably, absent-minded, but it had invariably been when he was
      &ldquo;suffering from nerves,&rdquo; as she phrased it to herself. But to-night he was
      obviously in the possession of unclouded faculties. She colored slightly
      and glanced under her lashes at Blessington. Had the same idea struck him,
      she wondered? But he was studiously studying a suit of Chinese armor that
      stood close by in a niche of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobby has been keeping me amused while you talked to Mr. Lakely,&rdquo; she
      said, pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly addressed, Loder turned and looked at Blessington. &ldquo;How d'you
      do?&rdquo; he said, with doubtful cordiality. The name of Bobby conveyed nothing
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise, Eve looked annoyed, and Blessington's fresh-colored face
      deepened in tone. With a slow, uncomfortable sensation he was aware of
      having struck a wrong note.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short, unpleasant pause. Then, more by intuition than actual
      sight, Blessington saw Eve's eyes turn from him to Loder, and with quick
      tact he saved the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you do, sir?&rdquo; he responded, with a smile. &ldquo;I congratulate you on
      looking so&mdash;so uncommon well. I was just telling Mrs. Chilcote that I
      hold a commission for Lady Astrupp to-night. I'm a sort of scout at
      present&mdash;reporting on the outposts.&rdquo; He spoke fast and without much
      meaning, but his boyish voice eased the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve thanked him with a smile. &ldquo;Then we mustn't interfere with a person on
      active service,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Besides, we have our own duties to get
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled again, and, touching Loder's arm, indicated the
      reception-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the larger of the two rooms Lady Bramfell was still
      receiving her guests. She was a tall and angular woman, who, except for a
      certain beauty of hands and feet and a certain similarity of voice,
      possessed nothing in common with her sister Lillian. She was speaking to a
      group of people as they approached, and the first sound of her sweet and
      rather drawling tones touched Loder with a curious momentary feeling&mdash;a
      vague suggestion of awakened memories. Then the suggestion vanished as she
      turned and greeted Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sweet of you to come!&rdquo; she murmured. And it seemed to Loder that a
      more spontaneous smile lighted up her face. Then she extended her hand to
      him. &ldquo;And you, too!&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Though I fear we shall bore you
      dreadfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Watching her with interest, he saw the change of expression as her eyes
      turned from Eve to him, and noticed a colder tone in her voice as she
      addressed him directly. The observation moved him to self-assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a poor compliment to me,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;To be bored is surely only a
      polite way of being inane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bramfell smiled. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You defending your social
      reputation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed a little. &ldquo;The smaller it is, the more defending it needs,&rdquo;
       he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another stream of arrivals swept by them as he spoke; Eve smiled at their
      hostess and moved across the room, and he perforce followed. As he gained
      her side, the little court about Lady Bramfell was left well in the rear,
      the great throng at the farther end of the room was not yet reached, and
      for the moment they were practically alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain uneasiness in that moment of companionship. It seemed
      to him that Eve wished to speak, but hesitated. Once or twice she opened
      and closed the fan that she was carrying, then at last, as if by an
      effort, she turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why were you so cold to Bobby Blessington?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Doesn't it seem
      discourteous to ignore him as you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her manner was subdued. It was not the annoyed manner that one uses to a
      man when he has behaved ill; it was the explanatory tone one might adopt
      towards an incorrigible child. Loder felt this; but the gist of a remark
      always came to him first, its mode of expression later. The fact that it
      was Blessington whom he had encountered&mdash;Blessington to whom he had
      spoken with vague politeness&mdash;came to him with a sense of
      unpleasantness. He was not to blame in the matter, nevertheless he blamed
      himself. He was annoyed that, he should have made the slip in Eve's
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were moving forward, nearing the press of people in the second room,
      when Eve spoke, and the fact filled him with an added sense of annoyance.
      People smiled and bowed to her from every side; one woman leaned forward
      as they passed and whispered something in her ear. Again the sensation of
      futility and vexation filled him; again he realized how palpable was the
      place she held in the world. Then, as his feelings reached their height
      and speech seemed forced upon him, a small man with a round face, catching
      a glimpse of Eve, darted from a circle of people gathered in one of the
      windows and came quickly towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an unjust touch of irritation he recognized Lord Bramfell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the sense of Eve's aloofness stung him as their host approached. In
      another moment she would be lost to him among this throng of strangers&mdash;claimed
      by them as by right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve&mdash;&rdquo; he said, involuntarily and under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She half paused and turned towards him. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said; and he wondered
      if it was his imagination that made the word sound slightly eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that matter of Blessington&mdash;&rdquo; he began. Then he stopped,
      Bramfell had reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man came up smiling and with an outstretched hand. &ldquo;There's no
      penalty for separating husband and wife, is there, Mrs. Chilcote? How are
      you, Chilcote?&rdquo; He turned from one to the other with the quick, noiseless
      manner that always characterized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned aside to hide his vexation, but Eve greeted their host with
      her usual self-possessed smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are exempt from all penalties to-night,&rdquo; she said. Then she turned to
      greet the members of his party who had strolled across from the window in
      his wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she moved aside Bramfell looked at Loder. &ldquo;Well, Chilcote, have you
      dipped into the future yet?&rdquo; he asked, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder echoed the laugh but said nothing. In his uncertainty at the
      question he reverted to his old resource of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bramfell raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don't tell me that my
      sister-in-law hasn't engaged you as a victim.&rdquo; Then he turned in Eve's
      direction. &ldquo;You've heard of our new departure, Mrs. Chilcote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve looked round from the lively group by which she was surrounded.
      &ldquo;Lillian's crystal-gazing? Why, of course!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She should make a
      very beautiful seer. We are all quite curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bramfell pursed up his lips. &ldquo;She has a very beautiful tent at the end of
      the conservatory. It took five men as many days to rig it up. We couldn't
      hear ourselves talk, for hammering. My wife said it made her feel quite
      philanthropic, it reminded her so much of a charity bazaar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed; and at the same moment Blessington came quickly across
      the room and joined the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anybody seen Witcheston? He's next on my list for the
      crystal business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the whole party laughed, and Bramfell, stepping forward, touched
      Blessington's arm in mock seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Witcheston is playing bridge, like a sensible man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Leave him
      in peace, Bobby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington made a comical grimace. &ldquo;But I'm working this on commercial
      principles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I keep the list, names and hours complete, and Lady
      Astrupp gazes, in blissful ignorance as to who her victims are. The whole
      thing is great&mdash;simple and statistical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake, Bobby, shut up!&rdquo; Bramfell's round eyes were twinkling
      with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my system&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Systems! Ah, we all had them when we were as young as you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they all had flaws, Bobby,&rdquo; Eve broke in. &ldquo;We were always finding
      gaps that had to be filled up. Never mind about Lord Witcheston. Get a
      substitute; it won't count&mdash;if Lillian doesn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington wavered as she spoke. His eyes wandered round the party and
      again rested on Bramfell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me, Bobby! Remember, I've breathed crystals&mdash;practically lived
      on them&mdash;for the last week. Now, there's Chilcote&mdash;&rdquo; Again his
      eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were turned on Loder, though one or two strayed surreptitiously
      to Eve. She, seeming sensitive to the position, laughed quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good idea!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who wants to see the future, if not a
      politician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder glanced from her to Blessington. Then, with a very feminine impulse,
      she settled the matter beyond dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please use your authority, Bobby,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And when you've got him
      safely under canvas, come back to me. It's years since we've had a talk.&rdquo;
       She nodded and smiled, then instantly turned to Bramfell with some trivial
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second Loder waited, then with a movement of resignation he laid his
      hand on Blessington's arm. &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if my fate is black,
      witness it was my wife who sent me to it.&rdquo; His faint pause on the word
      wife, the mention of the word itself in the presence of these people, had
      a savor of recklessness. The small discomfiture of his earlier slip
      vanished before it; he experienced a strong reaction of confidence in his
      luck. With a cool head, a steady step, and a friendly pressure of the
      fingers on Blessington's arm, he allowed himself to be drawn across the
      reception-rooms, through the long corridors, and down the broad flight of
      steps that led to the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conservatory was a feature of the Bramfell townhouse, and to Loder it
      came as something wonderful and unlooked-for&mdash;with its clustering
      green branches, its slight, unoppressive scents, its temperately pleasant
      atmosphere. He felt no wish to speak as, still guided by Blessington, he
      passed down the shadowy paths that in the half-light had the warmth and
      mystery of a Southern garden. Here and there from the darkness came the
      whispering of a voice or the sound of a laugh, bringing with them the
      necessary touch of life. Otherwise the place was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed by the air of solitude, contrasting so remarkably with the noise
      and crowded glitter left behind in the reception-rooms, he had moved
      half-way down the long, green aisle before the business in hand came back
      to him with a sudden sense of annoyance. It seemed so paltry to mar the
      quiet of the place with the absurdity of a side-show. He turned to
      Blessington with a touch of abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I expected to do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blessington looked up, surprised. &ldquo;Why, I thought, sir&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
      Then he instantly altered his tone: &ldquo;Oh, just enter into the spirit of the
      thing. Lady Astrupp won't put much strain on your credulity, but she'll
      make a big call on your solemnity.&rdquo; He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an infectious laugh, and Loder responded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. Being the priestess, she, naturally demands acolytes; but
      she'll let you know that she holds the prior place. The tent is so fixed
      that she sees nothing beyond your hands; so there's absolutely no
      delusion.&rdquo; He laughed once more. Then suddenly he lowered his voice and
      slackened his steps. &ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; he whispered, in pretended awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the path the space widened to the full breadth of the
      conservatory. The light was dimmer, giving an added impression of
      distance; away to the left, Loder heard the sound of splashing water, and
      on his right hand he caught his first glimpse of the tent that was his
      goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an artistic little structure&mdash;a pavilion formed of silky
      fabric that showed bronze in the light of an Oriental lamp that hung above
      its entrance. As they drew closer, a man emerged from it. He stood for a
      moment in uncertainty, looking about him; then, catching sight of them, he
      came forward laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it's as dark as limbo in there! I didn't see
      you at first. But I say, Blessington, it's a beastly shame to have that
      thunder-cloud barrier shutting off the sorceress. If she gazes at the
      crystal, mayn't we have something to gaze at, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington laughed. &ldquo;You want too much, Galltry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lady Astrupp
      understands the value of the unattainable. Come along, sir!&rdquo; he added to
      Loder, drawing him forward with an energetic pressure of the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder responded, and as he did so a flicker of curiosity touched his mind
      for the first time. He wondered for an instant who this woman was who
      aroused so much comment. And with the speculation came the remembrance of
      how she had assured Chilcote that on one point, at least he was
      invulnerable. He had spoken then from the height of a past experience&mdash;an
      experience so fully passed that he wondered now if it had been as staple a
      guarantee as he had then believed. Man's capacity for outliving is
      astonishingly complete. The long-ago incident in the Italian mountains had
      faded, like a crayon study in which the tones have merged and gradually
      lost character. The past had paled before the present&mdash;as golden hair
      might pale before black. The simile came with apparent irrelevance. Then
      again Blessington pressed his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir!&rdquo; he said, drawing away and lifting the curtain that hung before
      the entrance of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked at the amused, boyish face lighted by the hanging lamp, and
      smiled pleasantly; then, with a shrug of the shoulders, he entered the
      pavilion and the curtain fell behind him.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the pavilion, Loder's first feeling was one of annoyed
      awkwardness at finding himself in almost total darkness. But as his eyes
      grew accustomed to the gloom, the feeling vanished and the absurdity of
      the position came to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tent was small, heavily draped with silk and smelling of musk. It was
      divided into two sections by an immovable curtain that hung from the roof
      to within a few feet of the floor. The only furniture on Loder's side was
      one low chair, and the only light a faint radiance that, coming from the
      invisible half of the pavilion; spread across the floor in a pale band.
      For a short space he stood uncertain, then his hesitation was brought to
      an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; said a low, soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a further moment he stood undecided. The voice sounded so unexpectedly
      near. In the quiet and darkness of the place it seemed to possess a
      disproportionate weight&mdash;almost the weight of a familiar thing. Then,
      with a sudden, unanalyzed touch of relief, he located the impression. It
      was the similarity to Lady Bramfell's sweet, slow tones that had stirred
      his mind. With a sense of satisfaction he drew the chair forward and sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, he saw that on the other side of the gauze
      partition, and below it by a few inches, was a small table of polished
      wood, on which stood an open book, a crystal ball, and a gold dish filled
      with ink. These were arranged on the side of the table nearest to him, the
      farther side being out of his range of vision. An amused interest touched
      him as he made his position more comfortable. Whoever this woman was, she
      had an eye for stage management, she knew how to marshal her effects. He
      found himself waiting with some curiosity for the next injunction from
      behind the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The art of crystal-gazing,&rdquo; began the sweet, slow voice after a pause,
      &ldquo;is one of the oldest known arts.&rdquo; Loder sat forward. The thought of Lady
      Bramfell mingled disconcertingly with some other thought more distant and
      less easy to secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To obtain the best results,&rdquo; went on the seer, &ldquo;the subject lays his
      uncovered hands outspread upon a smooth surface.&rdquo; It was evident that the
      invisible priestess was reading from the open book, for when the word
      &ldquo;surface&rdquo; was reached there was a slight stir that indicated the changing
      of position; and when the voice came again it was in a different tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please lay your hands, palms downward, upon the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder smiled to himself in the darkness. He pictured Chilcote with his
      nerves and his impatience going through this ordeal; then in good-humored
      silence he leaned forward and obeyed the command. His hands rested on the
      smooth surface of the table in the bar of light from the unseen lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a second in which the seer was silent; then he fancied that she
      raised her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take off your rings,&rdquo; she said smoothly. &ldquo;Any metal interferes
      with the sympathetic current.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At any other time Loder would have laughed; but the request so casually
      and graciously made sent all possibility of irony far into the background.
      The thought of Chilcote and of the one flaw in their otherwise flawless
      scheme rose to his mind. Instinctively he half withdrew his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the sympathetic current?&rdquo; he asked, quietly. His thoughts were
      busy with the question of whether he would or would not be justified in
      beating an undignified retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between you and me, of course,&rdquo; said the voice, softly. It sounded
      languid, but very rational. The idea of retreat seemed suddenly
      theatrical. In this world of low voices and shaded lights people never
      adopted extreme measures&mdash;no occasion made a scene practicable, or
      even allowable. He leaned back slowly, while he summed up the situation.
      If by any unlucky chance this woman knew Chilcote to have adopted jewelry
      and had seen the designs of his rings, the sight of his own scarred finger
      would suggest question and comment; if, on the other hand, he left the
      pavilion without excuse, or if, without apparent reason, he refused to
      remove the rings, he opened up a new difficulty&mdash;a fresh road to
      curiosity. It came upon him with unusual quickness&mdash;the obstacles to,
      and the need for, a speedy decision. He glanced round the tent, then
      unconsciously he straightened his shoulders. After all, he had stepped
      into a tight corner, but there was no need to cry out in squeezing his way
      back. Then he realized that the soft, ingratiating tones were sounding
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the passing of my hands over yours, while I look into the crystal,
      that sets up sympathy&rdquo;&mdash;a slender hand moved swiftly into the light
      and picked up the ball&mdash;&ldquo;and makes my eyes see the pictures in your
      mind. Now, will you please take off your rings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very naturalness of the request disarmed him. It was a risk. But, as
      Chilcote had said, risk was the salt of life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you think me very troublesome.&rdquo; The voice came again,
      delicately low and conciliatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a brief second Loder wondered uncertainly how long or how well
      Chilcote knew Lady Astrupp; then he dismissed the question. Chilcote had
      never mentioned her until to-night, and then casually as Lady Bramfell's
      sister. What a coward he was becoming in throwing the dice with Fate!
      Without further delay he drew off the rings, slipped them into his pocket,
      and replaced his hands on the smooth table-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at the moment that he replaced them, a peculiar thing occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the farther side of the dark partition came the quick, rustling stir
      of a skirt, and the slight scrape of a chair pushed either backward or
      forward. Then there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, silence can suggest anything, from profound thought to imbecility;
      but in this case its suggestion was nil. That something had happened, that
      some change had taken place, was as patent to Loder as the darkness of the
      curtain or the band of light that crossed the floor, but what had
      occasioned it, or what it stood for, he made no attempt to decide. He sat
      bitingly conscious of his hands spread open on the table under the
      scrutiny of eyes that were invisible to him vividly aware of the
      awkwardness of his position. He felt with instinctive certainty that a new
      chord had been struck; but a man seldom acts on instinctive certainties.
      If the exposure of his hands had struck this fresh note, then any added
      action would but heighten the dilemma. He sat silent and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether his impassivity had any bearing on the moment he had no way of
      knowing; but no further movement came from behind the partition. Whatever
      the emotions that had caused the sharp swish of skirts and the sharp
      scrape of the chair, they had evidently subsided or been dominated by
      other feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next indication of life that came to him was the laying down of the
      crystal ball. It was laid back upon the table with a slight jerk that
      indicated a decision come to; and almost simultaneously the seer's voice
      came to him again. Her tone was lower now than it had been before, and its
      extreme ease seemed slightly shaken&mdash;whether by excitement, surprise,
      or curiosity, it was impossible to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think it strange&mdash;&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;You will think&mdash;&rdquo; Then
      she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, as though she waited for some help, but Loder remained
      mute. In difficulty a silent tongue and a cool head are usually man's best
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      His silence was disconcerting. He heard her stir again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think it strange&mdash;&rdquo; she began once more. Then quite
      suddenly she checked and controlled her voice. &ldquo;You must forgive me for
      what I am going to say,&rdquo; she added, in a completely different tone, &ldquo;but
      crystal-gazing is such an illusive thing. Directly you put your hands upon
      the table I felt that there would be no result; but I wouldn't admit the
      defeat. Women are such keen anglers that they can never acknowledge that
      any fish, however big, has slipped the hook.&rdquo; She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the laugh Loder shifted his position for the first time.
      He could not have told why, but it struck him with a slight sense of
      confusion. A precipitate wish to rise and pass through the doorway into
      the wider spaces of the conservatory came to him, though he made no
      attempt to act upon it. He knew that, for some inexplicable reason, this
      woman behind the screen had lied to him&mdash;in the controlling of her
      speech, in her charge of voice. There had been one moment in which an
      impulse or an emotion had almost found voice; then training, instinct, or
      it might have been diplomacy, had conquered, and the moment had passed.
      There was a riddle in the very atmosphere of the place&mdash;and he
      abominated riddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Astrupp was absorbed in her own concerns. Again she changed her
      position; and to Loder, listening attentively, it seemed that she leaned
      forward and examined his hands afresh. The sensation was so acute that he
      withdrew them involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a confused rustle; the crystal ball rolled from the table,
      and the seer laughed quickly. Obeying a strenuous impulse, Loder rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no definite notion of what he expected or what he must avoid. He
      was only conscious that the pavilion, with its silk draperies, its scent
      of musk, and its intolerable secrecy, was no longer endurable. He felt
      cramped and confused in mind and muscle. He stood for a second to
      straighten his limbs; then he turned, and, moving directly forward, passed
      through the portiere.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the dimness of the pavilion the conservatory seemed comparatively
      bright; but without waiting to grow accustomed to the altered light he
      moved onward with deliberate haste. The long, green alley, was speedily
      traversed; in his eyes it no longer possessed greenness, no longer
      suggested freshness or repose. It was simply a means to the end upon which
      his mind was set.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed up the flight of steps he drew his rings from his pocket and
      slipped them on again. Then he stepped into the glare of the thronged
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one hailed him as he passed through the crowd, but with Chilcote's
      most absorbed manner he hurried on. Through the door of the supper-room he
      caught sight of Blessington and Eve, and then for the first time his
      expression changed, and he turned directly towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you excuse me? I have a word to say to Blessington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him in momentary surprise; then she smiled in her quiet,
      self-possessed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I've been wanting a chat with Millicent Gower, but
      Bobby has required so much entertaining&mdash;&rdquo; She smiled again, this
      time at Blessington, and moved away towards a pale girl in green who was
      standing alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly she had turned Loder took Blessington's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you're tremendously busy,&rdquo; he began&mdash;in an excellent
      imitation of Chilcote's hasty manner&mdash;&ldquo;I know you're tremendously
      busy, but I'm in a fix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One glance at Blessington's healthy, ingenuous face told him that plain
      speaking was the method to adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir?&rdquo; In a moment Blessington was on the alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I&mdash;I want your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy reddened. That Chilcote should appeal to him stirred him to an
      uneasy feeling of pride and uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder saw his advantage and pressed it home. &ldquo;It's come about through this
      crystal-gazing business. I'm afraid I didn't play my part&mdash;rather
      made an ass of myself; I wouldn't swallow the thing, and&mdash;and Lady
      Astrupp&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, measuring Blessington with a glance. &ldquo;Well, my
      dear boy, you&mdash;you know what women are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington was only twenty-three. He reddened again, and assumed an air
      of profundity. &ldquo;I know sir,&rdquo; he said, with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder's sense of humor was keen, but he kept a grave face. &ldquo;I knew you'd
      catch my meaning; but I want you to do something more. If Lady Astrupp
      should ask you who was in her tent this past ten minutes, I want you&mdash;&rdquo;
       Again he stopped, looking at his companion's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to tell an immaterial lie for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington returned his glance; then he laughed a little uncomfortably.
      &ldquo;But surely, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She recognized me, you mean?&rdquo; Loder's eyes were as keen as steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're wrong. She didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blessington's eyebrows went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Loder glanced across the room. Eve had parted from the
      girl in green and was moving towards them, exchanging smiles and greetings
      as she came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife is coming back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you do this for me, Blessington?
      It&mdash;it will smooth things&mdash;&rdquo; He spoke quickly, continuing to
      watch Eve. As he had hoped, Blessington's eyes turned in the same
      direction. &ldquo;'Twill smooth matters,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;smooth them in&mdash;in
      a domestic way that I can't explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shot told. Blessington looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, sir!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may leave it to me,&rdquo; And before Loder could
      speak again he had turned and disappeared into the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0016" id="link2H_4_0016">

    </div>
    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      His business with Blessington over, Loder breathed more freely. If Lady
      Astrupp had recognized Chilcote by the rings, and had been roused to
      curiosity, the incident would demand settlement sooner or later&mdash;settlement
      in what proportion he could hazard no guess; if, on the other hand, her
      obvious change of manner had arisen from any other source he had a hazy
      idea that a woman's behavior could never be gauged by accepted theories&mdash;then
      he had safeguarded Chilcote's interests and his own by his securing of
      Blessington's promise. Blessington he knew would be reliable and discreet.
      With a renewal of confidence&mdash;a pleasant feeling that his uneasiness
      had been groundless&mdash;he moved forward to greet Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face, with its rich, clear coloring, seemed to his gaze to stand out
      from the crowd of other faces as from a frame, and a sense of pride
      touched him. In every eye but his own her beauty belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face looked alive and masterful as she reached his side. &ldquo;May I
      monopolize you?&rdquo; he said, with the quickness of speech borrowed from
      Chilcote. &ldquo;We see so little of each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost as if compelled, her lashes lifted and her eyes met his. Her glance
      was puzzled, uncertain, slightly confused. There was a deeper color than
      usual in her cheeks. Loder felt something within his own consciousness
      stir in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you are yielding,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the blush, and knew that it was he&mdash;his words, his personality&mdash;that
      had called it forth. In Chilcote's actual semblance he had proved his
      superiority over Chilcote. For the first time he had been given a tacit,
      personal acknowledgment of his power. Involuntarily he drew nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's get out of this crush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer except to bend her head; and it came to him that, for
      all her pride, she liked&mdash;and unconsciously yielded to&mdash;domination.
      With a satisfied gesture he turned to make a passage towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the passage was more easily desired than made. In the few moments
      since he had entered the supper-room the press of people had considerably
      thickened&mdash;until a block had formed about the door-way. Drawing Eve
      with him, he moved forward for a dozen paces, then paused, unable to make
      further headway.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they stood there, he looked back at her. &ldquo;What a study in democracy a
      crowd always is!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She responded with a bright, appreciative glance, as if surprised into
      naturalness. He wondered sharply what she would be like if her enthusiasms
      were really aroused. Then a stir in the corridor outside caused a movement
      inside the room; and with a certain display of persistence he was enabled
      to make a passage to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There again they were compelled to halt. But though tightly wedged into
      his new position and guarding Eve with one arm, Loder was free to survey
      the brilliantly thronged corridor over the head of a man a few inches
      shorter than himself, who stood directly in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we waiting for?&rdquo; he asked, good humoredly, addressing the back
      of the stranger's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man turned, displaying a genial face, a red mustache, and an
      eye-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Chilcote!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hope it's not on your feet I'm standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And don't change the position. If you were
      an inch higher I should be blind as well as crippled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed. It was a pleasant surprise to find Chilcote amiable
      under discomfort. He looked round again in slight curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder felt the scrutiny. To create a diversion he looked out along the
      corridor. &ldquo;I believe we are waiting for something,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What's
      this?&rdquo; Then quite abruptly be ceased to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything interesting?&rdquo; Eve touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing; he made no effort to look round. His thought as well as
      his speech was suddenly suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in front of him let his eye-glass fall from his eye, then screwed
      it in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Here comes our sorceress. It's like the progress of
      a fairy princess. I believe this is the meaning of our getting penned in
      here,&rdquo; he chuckled delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder said nothing. He stared straight on over the other's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the corridor, agreeably conscious of the hum of admiration she
      aroused, came Lillian Astrupp, surrounded by a little court. Her delicate
      face was lit up; her eyes shone under the faint gleam of her hair; her
      gown of gold embroidery swept round her gracefully. She was radiant and
      triumphant, but she was also excited. The excitement was evident in her
      laugh, in her gestures, in her eyes, as they turned quickly in one
      direction and then another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, gazing in stupefaction over the other man's head, saw it&mdash;felt
      and understood it with a mind that leaped back over a space of years. As
      in a shifting panorama he saw a night of disturbance and confusion in a
      far-off Italian valley&mdash;a confusion from which one face shone out
      with something of the pale, alluring radiance that filtered over the
      hillside from the crescent moon. It passed across his consciousness slowly
      but with a slow completeness; and in its light the incidents of the past
      hour stood out in a new aspect. The echo of recollection stirred by Lady
      Bramfell's voice, the re-echo of it in the sister's tones; his own
      blindness, his own egregious assurance&mdash;all struck across his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the party about Lillian drew nearer. He felt with instinctive
      certainty that the supper-room was its destination, but he remained
      motionless, held by a species of fatalism. He watched her draw near with
      an unmoved face, but in the brief space that passed while she traversed
      the corridor he gauged to the full the hold that the new atmosphere, the
      new existence, had gained over his mind. With an unlooked-for rush of
      feeling he realized how dearly he would part with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lillian came closer, the meaning of her manner became clearer to him.
      She talked incessantly, laughing now and then, but her eyes were never
      quiet. These skimmed the length of the corridor, then glanced over the
      heads crowded in the door-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have something quite sweet, Geoffrey,&rdquo; she was saying to the man
      beside her, as she came within hearing. &ldquo;You know what I like&mdash;a sort
      of snowflake wrapped up in sugar.&rdquo; As she said the words her glance
      wandered. Loder saw it rest uninterestedly on a boy a yard or two in front
      of him, then move to the man over whose head he gazed, then lift itself
      inevitably to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glance was quick and direct. He saw the look of recognition spring
      across it; he saw her move forward suddenly as the crowd in the corridor
      parted to let her pass. Then he saw what seemed to him a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her whole expression altered, her lips parted, and she colored with
      annoyance. She looked like a spoiled child who, seeing a bonbon-box, opens
      it&mdash;to find it empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the press about the door-way melted to give her passage, the red-haired
      man in front of Loder was the first to take advantage of the space. &ldquo;Jove!
      Lillian,&rdquo; he said, moving forward, &ldquo;you look as if you expected Chilcote
      to be somebody else, and are disappointed to find he's only himself!&rdquo; He
      laughed delightedly at his own joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were exactly the tonic that Lillian needed. She smiled her usual
      undisturbed smile as she turned her eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Leonard, you're using your eye-glass; when that happens you're
      never responsible for what you see.&rdquo; Her words came more slowly and with a
      touch of languid amusement. Her composure was suddenly restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time Loder changed his position. Moved by an impulse he
      made no effort to dissect, he stepped back to Eve's side and slipped his
      arm through hers&mdash;successfully concealing his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warmth of her skin through her long glove thrilled him unexpectedly.
      His impulse had been one of self-defence, but the result was of a
      different character. At the quick contact the wish to fight for&mdash;to
      hold and defend&mdash;the position that had grown so dear woke in renewed
      force. With a new determination he turned again towards Lillian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught the same impression&mdash;without an eyeglass,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why
      did you look like that?&rdquo; He asked the question steadily and with apparent
      carelessness, though, through it all, his reason stood aghast&mdash;his
      common-sense cried aloud that it was impossible for the eyes that had seen
      his face in admiration, in love, in contempt, to fail now in recognition.
      The air seemed breathless while he spoke and waited. His impression of
      Lillian was a mere shimmering of gold dress and gold hair; all that he was
      really conscious of was the pressure of his hand on Eve's arm and the
      warmth of her skin through the soft glove. Then, abruptly, the mist
      lifted. He saw Lillian's eyes&mdash;indifferent, amused, slightly
      contemptuous; and a second later he heard her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jack,&rdquo; she said, sweetly, &ldquo;how absurd of you! It was simply the
      contrast of your eyes peering over Leonard's hair It was like a gorgeous
      sunset with a black cloud overhead.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Do you see what I mean,
      Eve?&rdquo; She affected to see Eve for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve had been looking calmly ahead. She turned now and smiled serenely.
      Loder felt no vibration of the arm he held, yet by an instant intuition he
      knew that the two women were antagonistic. He experienced it with the
      divination that follows upon a moment of acute suspense. He understood it,
      as he had understood Lillian's look of recognition when his forehead,
      eyes, and nose had shown him to be himself; her blank surprise when his
      close-shaven lip and chin had proclaimed him Chilcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt like a man who has looked into an abyss and stepped back from the
      edge, outwardly calm but mentally shaken. The commonplaces of life seemed
      for the moment to hold deeper meanings. He did not hear Eve's answer, he
      paid no heed to Lillian's next remark. He saw her smile and turn to the
      red-haired man; finally he saw her move on into the supper-room, followed
      by her little court. Then he pressed the arm he was still holding. He felt
      an urgent need of companionship&mdash;of a human expression to the crisis
      he had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we get out of this?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve looked up. &ldquo;Out of the room?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her, compelling her gaze. &ldquo;Out of the room&mdash;and the
      house,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Let us go-home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The necessary formalities of departure were speedily got through. The
      passing of the corridors, the gaining of the carriage, seemed to Loder to
      be marvellously simple proceedings. Then, as he sat by Eve's side and
      again felt the forward movement of the horses, he had leisure for the
      first time to wonder whether the time that had passed since last he
      occupied that position had actually been lived through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only that night he had unconsciously compared one incident in his life to
      a sketch in which the lights and shadows have been obliterated and lost.
      Now that picture rose before him, startlingly and incredibly intact. He
      saw the sunlit houses of Santasalare, backgrounded by the sunlit hills&mdash;saw
      them as plainly as when he himself had sketched them on his memory. Every
      detail of the scene remained the same, even to the central figure; only
      the eye and the hand of the artist had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Eve broke in upon his thoughts. Her first words were
      curiously coincidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of Lillian Astrupp to-night?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Wasn't her
      gown perfect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder lifted his head with an almost guilty start. Then he answered
      straight from his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't notice it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but her eyes reminded me of a
      cat's eyes&mdash;and she walks like a cat. I never seemed to see it&mdash;until
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve changed her position. &ldquo;She was very artistic,&rdquo; she said, tentatively.
      &ldquo;Don't you think the gold gown was beautiful with her pale-colored hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder felt surprised. He was convinced that Eve disliked the other and he
      was not sufficiently versed in women to understand her praise. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began. Then he wisely stopped. &ldquo;I didn't see the gown,&rdquo; he substituted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve looked out of the window. &ldquo;How unappreciative men are!&rdquo; she said. But
      her tone was strangely free from censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this there was silence until Grosvenor Square was reached. Having
      left the carriage and passed into the house, Eve paused for a moment at
      the foot of the stairs to give an order to Crapham, who was still in
      attendance in the hall; and again Loder had an opportunity of studying
      her. As he looked, a sharp comparison rose to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fairy princess!&rdquo; he had heard the red-haired man say as Lillian Astrupp
      came into view along the Bramfells' corridor, and the simile had seemed
      particularly apt. With her grace, her delicacy, her subtle attraction, she
      might well be the outcome of imagination. But with Eve it was different.
      She also was graceful and attractive&mdash;but it was grace and attraction
      of a different order. One was beautiful with the beauty of the white rose
      that springs from the hot-house and withers at the first touch of cold;
      the other with the beauty of the wild rose on the cliffs above the sea,
      that keeps its petals fine and transparent in face of salt spray and wet
      mist. Eve, too, had her realm, but it was the realm of real things. A
      great confidence, a feeling that here one might rely even if all other
      faiths were shaken, touched him suddenly. For a moment he stood
      irresolute, watching her mount the stairs with her easy, assured step.
      Then a determination came to him. Fate favored him to-night; he was in
      luck tonight. He would put his fortune to one more test. He swung across
      the hall and ran up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was keen with interest as he reached her side. The hard outline
      of his features and the hard grayness of his eyes were softened as when he
      had paused to talk with Lakely. Action was the breath of his life, and his
      face changed under it as another's might change under the influence of
      stirring music or good wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve saw the look and again the uneasy expression of surprise crossed her
      eyes. She paused, her hand resting on the banister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked at her directly. &ldquo;Will you come into the study&mdash;as you
      came that other night? There's something I want to say.&rdquo; He spoke quietly.
      He felt master of himself and of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, glanced at him, and then glanced away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo; he said again. And as he said it his eyes rested on the
      sweep of her thick eyelashes, the curve of the black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last her lashes lifted, and the perplexity and doubt in her blue eyes
      stirred him. Without waiting for her answer, he leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say yes!&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I don't often ask for favors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she hesitated; then her decision was made for her. With a new
      boldness he touched her arm, drawing her forward gently but decisively
      towards Chilcote's rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the study a fire burned brightly, the desk was laden with papers, the
      lights were nicely adjusted; even the chairs were in their accustomed
      places. Loder's senses responded to each suggestion. It seemed but a day
      since he had seen it last. It was precisely as he had left it&mdash;the
      niche needing but the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      To hide his emotion he crossed the floor quickly and drew a chair forward.
      In less than six hours he had run up and down the scale of emotions. He
      had looked despair in the face, till the sudden sight of Chilcote had
      lifted him to the skies; since then, surprise had assailed him in its
      strongest form; he had known the full meaning of the word &ldquo;risk&rdquo;; and from
      every contingency he had come out conqueror. He bent over the chair as he
      pulled it forward, to hide the expression in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve moved towards him. She moved slowly, as if half afraid. Many emotions
      stirred her&mdash;distrust, uncertainty, and a curious half-dominant,
      half-suppressed questioning that it was difficult to define. Loder
      remembered her shrinking coldness, her reluctant tolerance on the night of
      his first coming, and his individuality, his certainty of power, kindled
      afresh. Never had he been so vehemently himself; never had Chilcote seemed
      so complete a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Eve seated herself, he moved forward and leaned over the back of her
      chair. The impulse that had filled him in his interview with Renwick, that
      had goaded him as he drove to the reception, was dominant again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to say something as we drove to the Bramfells' to-night,&rdquo; he
      began. Like many men who possess eloquence for an impersonal cause, he was
      brusque, even blunt, in the stating of his own case. &ldquo;May I hark back, and
      go on from where I broke off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve half turned. Her face was still puzzled and questioning. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
       She sat forward again, clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked thoughtfully at the back of her head, at the slim outline of her
      shoulders, the glitter of the diamonds about her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the day, three weeks ago, that we talked together in this
      room? The day a great many things seemed possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time she did not look round. She kept her gaze upon the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo; he persisted, quietly. In his college days men who
      heard that tone of quiet persistence had been wont to lose heart. Eve
      heard it now for the first time, and, without being aware, answered to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On that day you believed in me&mdash;&rdquo; In his earnestness he no longer
      simulated Chilcote; he spoke with his own steady reliance. He saw Eve
      stir, unclasp and clasp her hands, but he went steadily on. &ldquo;On that day
      you saw me in a new light. You acknowledged me.&rdquo; He emphasized the
      slightly peculiar word. &ldquo;But since that day&rdquo;&mdash;his voice quickened
      &ldquo;since that day your feelings have changed&mdash;your faith in me has
      fallen away.&rdquo; He watched her closely; but she made no sign, save to lean
      still nearer to the fire. He crossed his arms over the back of her chair.
      &ldquo;You were justified,&rdquo; he said, suddenly. &ldquo;I've not been&mdash;myself since
      that day.&rdquo; As he said the words his coolness forsook him slightly. He
      loathed the necessary lie, yet his egotism clamored for vindication. &ldquo;All
      men have their lapses,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;there are times&mdash;there are days
      and weeks when I&mdash;when my&mdash;&rdquo; The word &ldquo;nerves&rdquo; touched his
      tongue, hung upon it, then died away unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly, almost without a sound, Eve had risen and turned towards
      him. She was standing very straight, her face a little pale, the hand that
      rested on the arm of her chair trembling slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, quickly, &ldquo;don't say that word? Don't say that hideous
      word `nerves'! I don't feel that I can bear it to-night&mdash;not just
      to-night. Can you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder stepped back. Without comprehending, he felt suddenly and strangely
      at a loss. Something in her face struck him silent and perplexed. It
      seemed that without preparation he had stepped upon dangerous ground. With
      an undefined apprehension he waited, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't explain it,&rdquo; she went on with nervous haste, &ldquo;I can't give any
      reasons, but quite suddenly the&mdash;the farce has grown unbearable. I
      used not to think&mdash;used not even to care&mdash;but suddenly things
      have changed&mdash;or I have changed.&rdquo; She paused, confused and
      distressed. &ldquo;Why should it be? Why should things change?&rdquo; She asked the
      question sharp. ly, as if in appeal against her own incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned aside. He was afraid of the triumph, volcanic and
      irrepressible, that her admission roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned slowly back. &ldquo;You forget that I'm not a magician,&rdquo; he said,
      gently. &ldquo;I hardly know what you are speaking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she was silent, but in that moment her eyes spoke. Pain,
      distress, pride, all strove for expression; then at last her lips parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say that in seriousness?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no moment for fencing, and Loder knew it. &ldquo;In seriousness,&rdquo; he
      replied, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall speak seriously, too.&rdquo; Her voice shook slightly and the
      color came back into her face, but the hand on the arm of the chair ceased
      to tremble. &ldquo;For more than four years I have known that you take drugs&mdash;for
      more than four years I have acquiesced in your deceptions&mdash;in your
      meannesses&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant's silence. Then Loder stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew&mdash;for four years?&rdquo; he said, very slowly. For the first time
      that night he remembered Chilcote and forgot himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve lifted her head with a quick gesture&mdash;as if, in flinging off
      discretion and silence, she appreciated to the full the new relief of
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew. Perhaps I should have spoken when I first surprised the
      secret, but it's all so past that it's useless to speculate now. It was
      fate, I suppose. I was very young, you were very unapproachable, and&mdash;and
      we had no love to make the way easy.&rdquo; For a second her glance faltered and
      she looked away. &ldquo;A woman's&mdash;a girl's&mdash;disillusioning is a very
      sad comedy&mdash;it should never have an audience.&rdquo; She laughed a little
      bitterly as she looked back again. &ldquo;I saw all the deceits, all the
      subterfuges, all the&mdash;lies.&rdquo; She said the word deliberately, meeting
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he thought of Chilcote, but his face paled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it all. I lived with it all till I grew hard and indifferent&mdash;till
      I acquiesced in your 'nerves' as readily as the rest of the world that
      hadn't suspected and didn't know.&rdquo; Again she laughed nervously. &ldquo;And I
      thought the indifference would last forever. If one lives in a groove for
      years, one gets frozen up; I never felt more frozen than on the night Mr.
      Fraide spoke to me of you&mdash;asked me to use my influence; then, on
      that night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. On that night?&rdquo; Loder's voice was tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her excitement had suddenly fallen. Whether his glance had quelled it
      or whether the force of her feelings had worked itself out it was
      impossible to say, but her eyes had lost their resolution. She stood
      hesitating for a moment, then she turned and moved to the mantel-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night you found me&mdash;changed?&rdquo; Loder was insistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed&mdash;and yet not changed.&rdquo; She spoke reluctantly, with averted
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she was silent; then again a faint excitement tinged her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;It seemed&mdash;&rdquo; Once more she paused,
      hampered by her own uncertainty, her own sense of puzzling incongruity. &ldquo;I
      don't know why I speak like this,&rdquo; she went on at last, as if in
      justification of herself, &ldquo;or why I want to speak. But a feeling&mdash;an
      extraordinary, incomprehensible feeling seems to urge me on. The same
      feeling that came to me on the day we had tea together&mdash;the feeling
      that made me&mdash;that almost made me believe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe what?&rdquo; The words escaped him without volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sound of his voice she turned. &ldquo;Believe that a miracle had happened,&rdquo;
       she said&mdash;&ldquo;that you had found strength&mdash;had freed yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From morphia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From morphia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed, Loder lived through a century of suggestion
      and indecision. His first feeling was for himself, but his first clear
      thought was for Chilcote and their compact. He stood, metaphorically, on a
      stone in the middle of a stream, balancing on one foot, then the other;
      looking to the right bank, then to the left. At last, as it always did,
      inspiration came to him slowly. He realized that by one plunge he might
      save both Chilcote and himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed quickly to the fireplace and stood by Eve. &ldquo;You were right in
      your belief,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For all that time from the night you spoke to me
      of Fraide to the day you had tea in this room&mdash;I never touched a
      drug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved suddenly, and he saw her face. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, unsteadily,
      &ldquo;you&mdash;I&mdash;I have known you to lie to me&mdash;about other
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a hasty movement he averted his head. The doubt, the appeal in her
      words shocked him. The whole isolation of her life seemed summed up in the
      one short sentence. For the instant he forgot Chilcote. With a reaction of
      feeling he turned to her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; he said, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe I'm speaking the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She searched his eyes intently, the doubt and hesitancy still struggling
      in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the last three weeks?&rdquo; she said, reluctantly. &ldquo;How can you ask me to
      believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had expected this, and he met it steadily enough; nevertheless his
      courage faltered. To deceive this woman, even to justify himself, had in
      the last halfhour become something sacrilegious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last three weeks must be buried,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly. &ldquo;No man could
      free himself suddenly from&mdash;from a vice.&rdquo; He broke off abruptly. He
      hated Chilcote; he hated himself. Then Eve's face, raised in distressed
      appeal, overshadowed all scruples. &ldquo;You have been silent and patient for
      years,&rdquo; he said, suddenly. &ldquo;Can you be patient and silent a little
      longer?&rdquo; He spoke without consideration. He was conscious of no
      selfishness beneath his words. In the first exercise of conscious strength
      the primitive desire to reduce all elements to his own sovereignty
      submerged every other emotion. &ldquo;I can't enter into the thing,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;like you, I give no explanations. I can only tell you that on the day we
      talked together in this room I was myself&mdash;in the full possession of
      my reason, the full knowledge of my own capacities. The man you have known
      in the last three weeks, the man you have imagined in the last four years,
      is a shadow, an unreality&mdash;a weakness in human form. There is a new
      Chilcote&mdash;if you will only see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ewe was trembling as he ceased; her face was flushed; there was a strange
      brightness in her eyes She was moved beyond herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the other you&mdash;the old you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be patient.&rdquo; He looked down into the fire. &ldquo;Times like the last
      three weeks will come again&mdash;must come again; they are inevitable.
      When they do come, you must shut your eyes&mdash;you must blind yourself.
      You must ignore them&mdash;and me. Is it a compact?&rdquo; He still avoided her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him quietly. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if you wish it,&rdquo; she said, below her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of her glance, but he dared not meet it. He felt sick at
      the part he was playing, yet he held to it tenaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you could do what few men and fewer women are capable of?&rdquo; he
      asked, at last. &ldquo;I wonder if you could learn to live in the present?&rdquo; He
      lifted his head slowly and met her eyes. &ldquo;This is an&mdash;an experiment,&rdquo;
       he went on. &ldquo;And, like all experiments, it has good phases and bad. When
      the bad phases come round I&mdash;I want you to tell yourself that you are
      not altogether alone in your unhappiness&mdash;that I am suffering too&mdash;in
      another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence when he had spoken, and for a space it seemed that Eve
      would make no response. Then the last surprise in a day of surprises came
      to him. With a slight stir, a slight, quick rustle of skirts, she stepped
      forward and laid her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gesture was simple and very sweet; her eyes were soft and full of
      light as she raised her face to his, her lips parted in unconscious
      appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no surrender so seductive as the surrender of a proud woman.
      Loder's blood stirred, the undeniable suggestion of the moment thrilled
      and disconcerted him in a tumult of thought. Honor, duty, principle rose
      in a triple barrier; but honor, duty, and principle are but words to a
      headstrong man. The full significance of his position came to him as it
      had never come before. His hand closed on hers; he bent towards her, his
      pulses beating unevenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; he said. Then at sound of his voice he suddenly hesitated. It was
      the voice of a man who has forgotten everything but his own existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant he stayed motionless; then very quietly he drew away from
      her, releasing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No&mdash;I haven't got the right.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night, for almost the first time since he had adopted his dual role,
      Loder slept ill. He was not a man over whom imagination held any powerful
      sway&mdash;his doubts and misgivings seldom ran to speculation, upon
      future possibilities; nevertheless, the fact that, consciously or
      unconsciously, he had adopted a new attitude towards Eve came home to him
      with unpleasant force during the hours of darkness; and long before the
      first hint of daylight had slipped through the heavy window-curtains he
      had arranged a plan of action&mdash;a plan wherein, by the simple method
      of altogether avoiding her, he might soothe his own conscience and
      safeguard Chilcote's domestic interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a satisfactory if a somewhat negative arrangement, and he rose next
      morning with a feeling that things had begun to shape themselves. But
      chance sometimes has a disconcerting knack of forestalling even our
      best-planned schemes. He dressed slowly, and descended to his solitary
      breakfast with the pleasant sensation of having put last night out of
      consideration by the turning over of a new leaf; but scarcely had he
      opened Chilcote's letters, scarcely had he taken a cursory glance at the
      morning's newspaper, than it was borne in upon him that not only a new
      leaf, but a whole sheaf of new leaves, had been turned in his prospects&mdash;by
      a hand infinitely more powerful and arbitrary than his own. He realized
      within the space of a few moments that the leisure Eve might have claimed,
      the leisure he might have been tempted to devote to her, was no longer his
      to dispose of&mdash;being already demanded of him from a quarter that
      allowed of no refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first rumbling of the political earthquake that was to shake the
      country made itself audible beyond denial on that morning of March 27th,
      when the news spread through England that, in view of the disorganized
      state of the Persian army and the Shah's consequent inability to suppress
      the open insurrection of the border tribes in the north-eastern districts
      of Meshed, Russia, with a great show of magnanimity, had come to the
      rescue by despatching a large armed force from her military station at
      Merv across the Persian frontier to the seat of the disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To many hundreds of Englishmen who read their papers on that morning this
      announcement conveyed but little. That there is such a country as Persia
      we all know, that English interests predominate in the south and Russian
      interests in the north we have all superficially understood from
      childhood; but in this knowledge, coupled with the fact that Persia is
      comfortably far away, we are apt to rest content. It is only to the eyes
      that see through long-distance glasses, the minds that regard the present
      as nothing more nor less than an inevitable link joining the future to the
      past, that this distant, debatable land stands out in its true political
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the average reader of news the statement of Russia's move seemed
      scarcely more important than had the first report of the border risings in
      January, but to the men who had watched the growth of the disturbance it
      came charged with portentous meaning. Through the entire ranks of the
      opposition, from Fraide himself downward, it caused a thrill of
      expectation&mdash;that peculiar prophetic sensation that every politician
      has experienced at some moment of his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no member of his party did this feeling strike deeper root than in
      Loder. Imbued with a lifelong interest in the Eastern question, specially
      equipped by personal knowledge to hold and proclaim an opinion upon
      Persian affairs, he read the signs and portents with instinctive insight.
      Seated at Chilcote's table, surrounded by Chilcote's letters and papers,
      he forgot the breakfast that was slowly growing cold, forgot the interests
      and dangers, personal or pleasurable, of the night before, while his
      mental eyes persistently conjured up the map of Persia, travelling with
      steady deliberation from Merv to Meshed, from Meshed to Herat, from Herat
      to the empire of India! For it was not the fact that the Hazaras had risen
      against the Shah that occupied the thinking mind, nor was it the fact that
      Russian and not Persian troops were destined to subdue them, but the
      deeply important consideration that an armed Russian force had crossed the
      frontier and was encamped within twenty miles of Meshed-Meshed, upon which
      covetous Russian eyes have rested ever since the days of Peter the Great.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Loder's thoughts ran as he read and reread the news from the varying
      political stand-points, and so they continued to run when, some hours
      later, an urgent telephone message from the 'St. George's Gazette' asked
      him to call at Lakely's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message was interesting as well as imperative, and he made an instant
      response. The thought of Lakely's keen eyes and shrewd enthusiasms always
      possessed strong attractions for his own slower temperament, but even had
      this impetus been lacking, the knowledge that at the 'St. George's'
      offices, if anywhere, the true feelings of the party were invariably
      voiced would have drawn him without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was scarcely twelve o'clock when he turned the corner of the tall
      building, but already the keen spirit that Lakely everywhere diffused was
      making itself felt. Loder smiled to himself as his eyes fell on the day's
      placards with their uncompromising headings, and passed onward from the
      string of gayly painted carts drawn up to receive their first consignment
      of the paper to the troop of eager newsboys passing in and out of the big
      swing-doors with their piled-up bundles of the early edition; and with a
      renewed thrill of anticipation and energy he passed through the doorway
      and ran up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing unchallenged through the long corridor that led to Lakely's
      office, he caught a fresh impression of action and vitality from the click
      of the tape machines in the subeditors' office, and a glimpse through the
      open door of the subeditors themselves, each occupied with his particular
      task; then without time for further observation he found himself at
      Lakely's door. Without waiting to knock, as he had felt compelled to do on
      the one or two previous occasions that business had brought him there, he
      immediately turned the handle and entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Editors' offices differ but little in general effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lakely's surroundings were rather more elaborate than is usual, as became
      the dignity of the oldest Tory evening paper, but the atmosphere was
      unmistakable. As Loder entered he glanced up from the desk at which he was
      sitting, but instantly returned to his task of looking through and marking
      the pile of early evening editions that were spread around him. His coat
      was off and hung on the chair behind him, axed he pulled vigorously on a
      long cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! That's right,&rdquo; he said, laconically. &ldquo;Make yourself comfortable
      half a second, while I skim the 'St. Stephen's'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His salutation pleased Loder. With a nod of acquiescence he crossed the
      office to the brisk fire that burned in, the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two Lakely worked steadily, occasionally breaking the
      quiet by an unintelligible remark or a vigorous stroke of his pencil. At
      last he dropped the paper with a gesture of satisfaction and leaned back
      in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what d'you think of this? How's this for a
      complication?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned round. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;that we can't
      overestimate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lakely laughed and took a long pull at his cigar. &ldquo;And we mustn't be
      afraid to let the Sefborough crowd know it, eh?&rdquo; He waved his hand to the
      poster of the first edition that hung before his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, following his glance, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lakely laughed again. &ldquo;They might have known it all along, if they'd cared
      to deduce,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did they really believe that Russia was going to sit
      calmly looking across the Heri-Rud while the Shah played at mobilizing?
      But what became of you last night? We had a regular prophesying of the
      whole business at Bramfell's; the great Fraide looked in for five minutes.
      I went on with him to the club afterwards and was there when the news came
      in. 'Twas a great night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder's face lighted up. &ldquo;I can imagine it,&rdquo; he said, with an unusual
      touch of warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lakely watched him intently for a moment. Then with a quick action he
      leaned forward and rested his elbows on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be something more than imagination for you, Chilcote,&rdquo; he
      said, impressively. &ldquo;It's going to be solid earnest!&rdquo; He spoke rapidly and
      with rather more than his usual shrewd decisiveness; then he paused to see
      the effect of his announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder was still studying the flaring poster. At the other's words he
      turned sharply. Something in Lakely's voice, something in his manner,
      arrested him. A tinge of color crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reality?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a further space his companion watched him; then with a rapid movement
      he tilted back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes; old Fraide's instincts are never far out. He's quite
      right. You're the man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still quietly, but with a strange underglow of excitement, Loder left the
      fire, and, coming forward, took a chair at Lakely's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind telling me what you're driving at?&rdquo; he asked, in his old,
      laconic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lakely still scrutinized him with an air of brisk satisfaction; then with
      a gesture of finality he tossed his cigar away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there's going to be a breach somewhere&mdash;and
      Fraide says you're the man to step in and fill it! You see, five years
      ago, when things looked lively on the Gulf and the Bundar Abbas business
      came to light, you did some promising work; and a reputation like that
      sticks to a man&mdash;even when he turns slacker! I won't deny that you've
      slacked abominably,&rdquo; he added, as Loder made an uneasy movement, &ldquo;but
      slacking has different effects. Some men run to seed, others mature. I had
      almost put you down on the black list, but I've altered my mind in the
      last two months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder stirred in his seat. A host of emotions were stirring in his
      mind. Every word wrung from Lakely was another stimulus to pride, another
      subtle tribute to the curious force of personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lakely smiled. &ldquo;We all know that Sefborough's ministry is&mdash;well,
      top-heavy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sefborough is building his card house just a story
      too high. It's a toss-up what 'll upset the balance. It might be the army,
      of course, or it might be education; but it might quite as well be a
      matter of foreign policy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other in comprehensive silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know as well as I that it's not the question of whether Russia comes
      into Persia, but the question of whether Russia goes out of Persia when
      these Hazaras are subdued! I'll lay you what you like, Chilcote, that
      within one week we hear that the risings are suppressed, but that Russia,
      instead of retiring, has advanced those tempting twenty miles and
      comfortably ensconced herself at Meshed&mdash;as she ensconced herself on
      the island of Ashurada. Lakely's nervous, energetic figure was braced, his
      light-blue eyes brightened, by the intensity of his interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this news comes before the Easter recess,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the first nail
      can be hammered in on the motion for adjournment. And if the right man
      does it in the right way, I'll lay my life 'twill be a nail in
      Sefborough's coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder sat very still. Overwhelming possibilities had suddenly opened
      before him. In a moment the unreality of the past months had become real;
      a tangible justification of himself and his imposture was suddenly made
      possible. In the stress of understanding he, too, leaned forward, and,
      resting his elbows on the desk, took his face between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space Lakely made no remark. To him man and man's moods came second
      in interest to his paper and his party politics. That Chilcote should be
      conscious of the glories he had opened up seemed only natural; that he
      should show that consciousness in a becoming gravity seemed only right.
      For some seconds he made no attempt to disturb him; but at last his own
      irrepressible activity made silence unendurable. He caught up his pencil
      and tapped impatiently on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilcote,&rdquo; he said, quickly and with a gleam of sudden anxiety, &ldquo;you're
      not by any chance doubtful of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At sound of his voice Loder lifted his face; it was quite pale again, but
      the energy and resolution that had come into it when Lakely first spoke
      were still to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lakely,&rdquo; he said, very slowly, &ldquo;it's not the sort of moment in which
      a man doubts himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      And so it came about that Loder was freed from one responsibility to
      undertake another. From the morning of March 27th, when Lakely had
      expounded the political programme in the offices of the 'St. George's
      Gazette', to the afternoon of April 1st he found himself a central figure
      in the whirlpool of activity that formed itself in Conservative circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the acumen for which he was noted, Lakely had touched the key-stone
      of the situation on that morning; and succeeding events, each fraught with
      its own importance, had established the precision of his forecast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minutely watchful of Russia's attitude, Fraide quietly organized his
      forces and strengthened his position with a statesmanlike grasp of
      opportunity; and to Loder the attributes displayed by his leader during
      those trying days formed an endless and absorbing study. Setting the
      thought of Chilcote aside, ignoring his own position and the risks he
      daily ran, he had fully yielded to the glamour of the moment, and in the
      first freedom of a loose rein he had given unreservedly all that he
      possessed of activity, capacity, and determination to the cause that had
      claimed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singularly privileged in a constant, personal contact with Fraide, he
      learned many valuable lessons of tact and organization in those five vital
      days during which the tactics of a whole party hung upon one item of news
      from a country thousands of miles away. For should Russia subdue the
      insurgent Hazaras and, laden with the honors of the peacemaker, retire
      across the frontier, then the political arena would remain undisturbed;
      but should the all-important movement predicted by Lakely become an
      accepted fact before Parliament rose for the Easter recess, then the first
      blow in the fight that would rage during the succeeding session must
      inevitably be struck. In the mean time it was Fraide's difficult position
      to wait and watch and yet preserve his dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early in the afternoon of March 29th that Loder, in response to a
      long-standing invitation, lunched quietly with the Fraides. Being delayed
      by some communications from Wark, he was a few minutes late in keeping his
      appointment, and on being shown into the drawing-room found the little
      group of three that was to make up the party already assembled&mdash;Fraide,
      Lady Sarah&mdash;and Eve. As he entered the room they ceased to speak, and
      all three turned in his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first moment he had a vague impression of responding suitably to
      Lady Sarah's cordial greeting; but he knew that immediately and
      unconsciously his eyes turned to Eve, while a quick sense of surprise and
      satisfaction passed through him at sight of her. For an instant he
      wondered how she would mark his avoidance of her since their last eventful
      interview; then instantly he blamed himself for the passing doubt. For,
      before all things, he knew her to be a woman of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Fraide's outstretched hand; and again he looked towards Eve,
      waiting for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his glance, but said nothing. Instead of speaking she smiled at
      him&mdash;a smile that was far more reassuring than any words, a smile
      that in a single second conveyed forgiveness, approbation, and a warm,
      almost tender sense of sympathy and comprehension. The remembrance of that
      smile stayed with him long after they were seated at table; and far into
      the future the remembrance of the lunch itself, with its pleasant private
      sense of satisfaction, was destined to return to him in retrospective
      moments. The delightful atmosphere of the Fraides' home life had always
      been a wonder and an enigma to him; but on this day he seemed to grasp its
      meaning by a new light, as he watched Eve soften under its influence and
      felt himself drawn imperceptibly from the position of a speculative
      outsider to that of an intimate. It was a fresh side to the complex,
      fascinating life of which Fraide was the master spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections had grown agreeably familiar to his mind; the talk,
      momentarily diverted into social channels, was quietly drifting back to
      the inevitable question of the &ldquo;situation&rdquo; that in private moments was
      never far from their lips, when the event that was to mark and separate
      that day from those that had preceded it was unceremoniously thrust upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without announcement or apology, the door was suddenly flung open and
      Lakely entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was brimming with excitement, and his eyes flashed. In the first
      haste of the entry he failed to see that there were ladies in the room,
      And, crossing instantly to Fraide, laid an open telegram before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is official, sir,&rdquo; he said. Then at last he glanced round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Sarah!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Can you forgive me? But I'd have given a
      hundred pounds to be the first with this!&rdquo; He glanced back at Fraide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah rose and stretched out her hand. &ldquo;Mr. Lakely,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
      more than understand!&rdquo; There was a thrill in her warm, cordial voice, and
      her eyes also turned towards her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the whole party, Fraide alone was perfectly calm. He sat very still,
      his small, thin figure erect and dignified, as his eyes scanned the
      message that meant so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve, who had sprung from her seat and passed round the table at sound of
      Lakely's news, was leaning over his shoulder, reading the telegram with
      him. At the last word she lifted her head, her face flushed with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid it must be to be a man!&rdquo; she exclaimed. And without
      premeditation her eyes and Loder's met.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner came the news from Persia, and with it Loder's definite
      call. In the momentary stress of action it was impossible that any thought
      of Chilcote could obtrude itself. Events had followed each other too
      rapidly, decisive action had been too much thrust upon him, to allow of
      hesitation; and it was in this spirit, under this vigorous pressure, that
      he made his attack upon the government on the day that followed Fraide's
      luncheon party.
    </p>
    <p>
      That indefinable attentiveness, that alert sensation of impending storm.
      that is so strong an index of the parliamentary atmosphere was very keen
      on that memorable first of April. It was obvious in the crowded benches on
      both sides of the House&mdash;in the oneness of purpose that insensibly
      made itself felt through the ranks of the Opposition, and found definite
      expression in Fraide's stiff figure and tightly shut lips&mdash;in the
      unmistakable uneasiness that lay upon the ministerial benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      But notwithstanding these indications of battle, the early portion of the
      proceedings was unmarked by excitement, being tinged with the purposeless
      lack of vitality that had of late marked all affairs of the Sefborough
      Ministry; and it was not until the adjournment of the House for the Easter
      recess had at last been moved that the spirit of activity hovering in the
      air descended and galvanized the assembly into life. It was then, amid a
      stir of interest, that Loder slowly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many curious incidents have marked the speech-making annals of the House
      of Commons, but it is doubtful whether it has ever been the lot of a
      member to hear his own voice raised for the first time on a subject of
      vital interest to his party, having been denied all initial assistance of
      minor questions asked or unimportant amendments made. Of all those
      gathered together in the great building on that day, only one man
      appreciated the difficulty of Loder's position&mdash;and that man was
      Loder himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose slowly and stood silent for a couple of seconds, his body braced,
      his fingers touching the sheaf of notes that lay in front of him. To the
      waiting House the silence was effective. It might mean over-assurance, or
      it might mean a failure of nerve at a critical moment. Either possibility
      had a tinge of piquancy. Moved by the same impulse, fifty pairs o eyes
      turned upon him with new interest; but up in the Ladies' Gallery Eve
      clasped her hands in sudden apprehension; and Fraide, sitting stiffly in
      his seat, turned and shot one swift glance at the man on whom, against
      prudence and precedent, he had pinned his faith. The glance was swift but
      very searching, and with a characteristic movement of his wiry shoulders
      he resumed his position and his usual grave, attentive attitude. At the
      same moment Loder lifted his head and began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at the outset his inexperience met him. His voice, pitched too low,
      only reached those directly near him. It was a moment of great strain.
      Eve, listening intently, drew a long breath of suspense and let her
      fingers drop apart; the sceptical, watchful eyes that faced him, line upon
      line, seemed to flash and brighten with critical interest; only Fraide
      made no change of expression. He sat placid, serious, attentive, with the
      shadow of a smile behind his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder paused, but this time the pause was shorter. The ordeal he had
      dreaded and waited for was passed and he saw his way clearly. With the old
      movement of the shoulders he straightened himself and once more began to
      speak. This time his voice rang quietly true and commanding across the
      floor of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      No first step can be really great; it must of necessity possess more of
      prophecy than of achievement; nevertheless it is by the first step that a
      man marks the value, not only of his cause, but of himself. Following
      broadly on the lines that tradition has laid down for the Conservative
      orator, Loder disguised rather than displayed the vein of strong,
      persuasive eloquence that was his natural gift. The occasion that might
      possibly justify such a display of individuality might lie with the
      future, but it had no application to the present. For the moment his duty
      was to voice his party sentiments with as much lucidity, as much logic,
      and as much calm conviction as lay within his capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing quietly in Chilcote's place, he was conscious with a deep sense
      of gravity of the peculiarity of his position; and perhaps it was this
      unconscious and unstudied seriousness that lent him the tone of weight and
      judgment so essential to the cause he had in hand. It has always been
      difficult to arouse the interest of the House on matters of British policy
      in Persia. Once aroused, it may, it is true, reach fever heat with
      remarkable rapidity, but the introductory stages offer that worst danger
      to the earnest speaker&mdash;the dread of an apathetic audience. But from
      this consideration Loder, by his sharp consciousness of personal
      difficulties, was given immunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitching his voice in that quietly masterful tone that beyond all others
      compels attention, he took up his subject and dealt with it with
      dispassionate force. With great skill he touched on the steady southward
      advance of Russia into Persian territory from the distant days when, by a
      curious irony of fate, Russian and British enterprise combined to make
      entry into the country under the sanction of the Grand-Duke of Moscovy, to
      the present hour, when this great power of Russia&mdash;long since
      alienated by interests and desires from her former co-operator&mdash;had
      taken a step which in the eyes of every thinking man must possess a deep
      significance. With quiet persistence he pointed out the peculiar position
      of Meshed in the distant province of Khorasan; its vast distance from the
      Persian Gulf, round which British interests and influence centre, and the
      consequently alarming position of hundreds of traders who, in the security
      of British sovereignty, are fighting their way upward from India, from
      Afghanistan, even from England herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following up his point, he dilated on these subjects of the British crown
      who, cut off from adequate assistance, can only turn in personal or
      commercial peril to the protective power of the nearest consulate. Then,
      quietly demanding the attention of his hearers, he marshalled fact after
      fact to demonstrate the isolation and inadequacy of a consulate so
      situated; the all but arbitrary power of Russia, who in her new occupation
      of Meshed had only two considerations to withhold her from open aggression&mdash;the
      knowledge of England as a very considerable but also a very distant power;
      the knowledge of Persia as an imminent but wholly impotent factor in the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having stated his opinions, he reverted to the motive of his speech&mdash;his
      desire to put forward a strong protest against the adjournment of the
      House without an assurance from the government that immediate measures
      would be taken to safeguard British interests in Meshed and throughout the
      province of Khorasan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate outcome of Loder's speech was all that his party had
      desired. The effect on the House had been marked; and when, no
      satisfactory response coming to his demand, he had in still more resolute
      and insistent terms called for a division on the motion for adjournment,
      the result had been an appreciable fall in the government majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Loder himself, the realization that he had at last vindicated and
      justified himself by individual action had a peculiar effect. His position
      had been altered in one remarkable particular. Before this day he alone
      had known himself to be strong; now the knowledge was shared by others and
      he was human enough to be susceptible to the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first appreciation of it came immediately after the excitement of the
      division, when Fraide, singling him out, took his arm and pressed it
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Chilcote,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are all proud of you!&rdquo; Then, looking up
      into his face, he added, in a graver tone, &ldquo;But keep your mind upon the
      future; never be blinded by the present&mdash;however bright it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the touch of his hand, at the spontaneous approval of his first words,
      Loder's pride thrilled, and in a vehement rush of ambition his senses
      answered to the praise. Then, as Fraide in all unconsciousness added his
      second sentence, the hot glow of feeling suddenly chilled. In a sweep of
      intuitive reaction the meaning and the danger of his falsely real position
      extinguished his excitement and turned his triumph cold. With an
      involuntary gesture he withdrew his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very good, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you're very right. We never should
      forget that there is&mdash;a future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man glanced up, surprised by the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Chilcote,&rdquo; he said, kindly. &ldquo;But we only advise those in whom
      we believe to look towards it. Shall we find my wife? I know she will want
      to bear you home with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Loder's joy in himself and his achievement had dropped from him. He
      shrank suddenly from Lady Sarah's congratulations and Eve's warm, silent
      approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don't feel fit for society. A touch of my&mdash;nerves,
      I suppose.&rdquo; He laughed shortly. &ldquo;But do you mind saying to Eve that I hope
      I have&mdash;satisfied her?&rdquo; he added this as if in half-reluctant
      after-thought. Then, with a short pressure of Fraide's hand, he turned,
      evading the many groups that waited to claim him, and passed out of the
      House alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hailing a cab, he drove to Grosvenor Square. All the exaltation of an hour
      ago had turned to ashes. His excitement had found its culmination in a
      sense of futility and premonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met no one in the hall or on the stairs of Chilcote's house, and on
      entering the study he found that also deserted. Greening had been among
      the most absorbed of those who had listened to his speech. Passing at once
      into the room, he crossed as if by instinct to the desk, and there halted.
      On the top of some unopened letters lay the significant yellow envelope of
      a telegram&mdash;the telegram that in an unformed, subconscious way had
      sprung to his expectation on the moment of Fraide's congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly he picked it up, opened and read it, and, with the automatic
      caution that had become habitual, carried it across the room and dropped
      it in the fire. This done, he returned to the desk, read the letters that
      awaited Chilcote, and, scribbling the necessary notes upon the margins,
      left them in readiness for Greening. Then, moving with the same quiet
      suppression, he passed from the room, down the stairs, and out into the
      street by the way he had come.

    <h2>
      XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the fifth day after the momentous 1st of April on which he had recalled
      Loder and resumed his own life Chilcote left his house and walked towards
      Bond Street. Though the morning was clear and the air almost warm for the
      time of year, he was buttoned into a long overcoat and was wearing a
      muffler and a pair of doeskin gloves. As he passed along the street he
      kept close to the house fronts to avoid the sun that was everywhere
      stirring the winterbound town, like a suffusion of young blood through old
      veins. He avoided the warmth because in this instance warmth meant light,
      but as he moved he shivered slightly from time to time with the haunting,
      permeating cold that of late had become his persistent shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ill at case as he hurried forward. With each succeeding day of the
      old life the new annoyances, the new obligations became more hampering.
      Before his compact with Loder this old life had been a net about his feet;
      now the meshes seemed to have narrowed, the net itself to have spread till
      it smothered his whole being. His own household&mdash;his own rooms, even&mdash;offered
      no sanctuary. The presence of another personality tinged the atmosphere.
      It was preposterous, but it was undeniable. The lay figure that he had set
      in his place had proved to be flesh and blood&mdash;had usurped his life,
      his position, his very personality, by sheer right of strength. As he
      walked along Bond Street in the first sunshine of the year, jostled by the
      well-dressed crowd, he felt a pariah.
    </p>
    <p>
      He revolted at the new order of things, but the revolt was a silent
      one-the iron of expediency had entered into his soul. He dared not
      jeopardize Loder's position, because he dared not dispense with Loder. The
      door that guarded his vice drew him more resistlessly with every
      indulgence, and Loder's was the voice that called the &ldquo;Open Sesame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked on aimlessly. He had been but five days at home, and already the
      quiet, grass-grown court of Clifford's Inn, the bare staircase, the
      comfortless privacy of Loder's rooms seemed a haven of refuge. The speed
      with which this hunger had returned frightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked forward rapidly and without encountering a check. Then,
      suddenly, the spell was broken. From the slowly moving, brilliantly
      dressed throng of people some one called him by his name; and turning he
      saw Lillian Astrupp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was stepping from the door of a jeweller's, and as he turned she
      paused, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very person I would have wished to see!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Where have
      you been these hundred years? I've heard of nobody but you since you've
      turned politician and ceased to be a mere member of Parliament!&rdquo; She
      laughed softly. The laugh suited the light spring air, as she herself
      suited the pleasant, superficial scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and held it, while his eyes travelled from her delicate
      face to her pale cloth gown, from her soft furs to the bunch of roses
      fastened in her muff, The sight of her was a curious relief. Her cool,
      slim fingers were so casual, yet so clinging, her voice and her presence
      were so redolent of easy, artificial things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well you look!&rdquo; he said, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she laughed. &ldquo;That's my prerogative,&rdquo; she responded, lightly. &ldquo;But I
      was serious in being glad to see you. Sarcastic people are always so
      intuitive. I'm looking for some one with intuition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote glanced up. &ldquo;Extravagant again?&rdquo; he said, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him sweetly. &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she murmured with slow reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed quickly. &ldquo;I understand. You've changed your Minister of
      Finance. I'm wanted in some other direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time her reproach was expressed by a glance. &ldquo;You are always wanted,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to rouse him again to the shadowy self-distrust that the
      sight of her had lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's delightful to meet you like this,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and I wish
      the meeting wasn't momentary. But I'm&mdash;I'm rather pressed for time.
      You must let me come round one afternoon&mdash;or evening, when you're
      alone.&rdquo; He fumbled for a moment with the collar of his coat, and glanced
      furtively upward towards Oxford Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again Lillian smiled&mdash;this time to herself. If she understood
      anything on earth it was Chilcote and his moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one may be careless of anything, Jack,&rdquo; she said, lightly, &ldquo;surely
      it's of time. I can imagine being pressed for anything else in the world.
      If it's an appointment you're worrying about, a motor goes ever so much
      faster than a cab&mdash;&rdquo; She looked at him tentatively, her head slightly
      on one side, her muff raised till the roses and some of the soft fur
      touched her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked very charming and very persuasive as Chilcote glanced back.
      Again she seemed to represent a respite&mdash;something graceful and
      subtle in a world of oppressive obligations. His eyes strayed from her
      figure to the smart motor-car drawn up beside the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the glance. &ldquo;Ever so much quicker,&rdquo; she insinuated; and, smiling
      again, she stepped forward from the door of the shop. After a second's
      indecision Chilcote followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiting car had three seats&mdash;one in front for the chauffeur, two
      vis-a-vis at the back, offering pleasant possibilities of a tete-a-tete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Park&mdash;and drive slowly,&rdquo; Lillian ordered, as she stepped inside,
      motioning Chilcote to the seat opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved up Bond Street smoothly and rapidly. Lillian was absorbed in
      the passing traffic until the Marble Arch was reached; then, as they
      glided through the big gates, she looked across at her companion. He had
      turned up the collar of his coat, though the wind was scarcely
      perceptible, and buried, himself in it to the ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extraordinary!&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly, as her eyes rested on his
      face. It was seldom that she felt drawn to exclamation. She was usually
      too indolent to show surprise. But now the feeling was called forth before
      she was aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote looked up. &ldquo;What's extraordinary?&rdquo; he said, sensitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward for an instant and touched his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear!&rdquo; she said, teasingly. &ldquo;Did I rub your fur the wrong way?&rdquo; Then,
      seeing his expression, she tactfully changed her tone. &ldquo;I'll explain. It
      was the same thing that struck me the night of Blanche's party&mdash;when
      you looked at me over Leonard Kaine's head. You remember?&rdquo; She glanced
      away from him across the Park to where the grass was already showing
      greener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote felt ill at ease. Again he put his hand to his coat collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said, hastily&mdash;&ldquo;yes.&rdquo; He wished now that he had
      questioned Loder more closely on the proceedings of that party. It seemed
      to him, on looking back, that Loder had mentioned nothing on the day of
      their last exchange but the political complications that absorbed his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't explain then,&rdquo; Lillian went on. &ldquo;I couldn't explain before a
      crowd of people that it wasn't your dark head showing over Leonard's red
      one that surprised me, but the most wonderful, the most extraordinary
      likeness&mdash;&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was moving slower; there was a delight in the easy motion through
      the fresh, early air. But Chilcote's uneasiness had been aroused. He no
      longer felt soothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What likeness?&rdquo; he asked, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him easily. &ldquo;Oh, a likeness I have noticed before,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;A likeness that always seemed strange, but that suddenly became
      incredible at Blanche's party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved quickly. &ldquo;Likenesses are an illusion,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a mere
      imagination of the brain!&rdquo; His manner was short; his annoyance seemingly
      out of all proportion to its cause. Lillian looked at him afresh in
      slightly interested surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet not so very long ago, you yourself&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;I've always denied likenesses. Such things don't
      really exist. Likeness-seeing is purely an individual matter&mdash;a
      preconception.&rdquo; He spoke fast; he was uneasy under the cool scrutiny of
      her green eyes. And with a sharp attempt at self-control and reassurance
      he altered his voice. &ldquo;After all, we're being very stupid!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;We're worrying over something that doesn't exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lillian was still lazily interested. To her own belief, she had seen
      Chilcote last on the night of her sister's reception. Then she had been
      too preoccupied to notice either his manner or his health, though
      superficially it had lingered in her mind that he had seemed unusually
      reliant, unusually well on that night. A remembrance of the impression
      came to her now as she studied his face, upon which imperceptibly and yet
      relentlessly his vice was setting its mark&mdash;in the dull restlessness
      of eye, the unhealthy sallowness of skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some shred of her thought, some suggestion of the comparison running
      through her mind, must have shown in her face, for Chilcote altered his
      position with a touch of uneasiness. He glanced away across the long sweep
      of tan-covered drive stretching between the trees; then he glanced
      furtively back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-way,&rdquo; he said, quickly, &ldquo;you wanted me for something?&rdquo; The memory
      of her earlier suggestion came as a sudden boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her muff again and smelled her roses thoughtfully. &ldquo;Oh, it was
      nothing, really,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You sarcastic people give very shrewd
      suggestions sometimes, and I've been rather wanting a suggestion on an&mdash;an
      adventure that I've had.&rdquo; She looked down at her flowers with a charmingly
      attentive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote's restlessness had increased. Looking up, she suddenly caught
      the expression, and her own face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jack,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;what a bore I am! Let's forget tedious
      things&mdash;and enjoy ourselves.&rdquo; She leaned towards him caressingly with
      an air of concern and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action was not without effect. Her soothing voice, her smile, her
      almost affectionate gesture, each carried weight. With a swift return of
      assurance he responded to her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Right! We will enjoy ourselves!&rdquo; He laughed quickly,
      and again with a conscious movement lifted his hand to his muffler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll postpone the advice?&rdquo; Lillian laughed, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Right! We'll postpone it.&rdquo; The word pleased him and he caught at it.
      &ldquo;We won't bother about it now, but we won't shelve it altogether. We'll
      postpone it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; She settled herself more comfortably. &ldquo;You'll dine with me one
      night&mdash;and we can talk it out then. I see so little of you nowadays,&rdquo;
       she added, in a lower voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl, you're unfair!&rdquo; Chilcote's spirits had risen; he spoke
      rapidly, almost pleasantly. &ldquo;It isn't I who keep away&mdash;it's the
      stupid affairs of the world that keep me. I'd be with you every hour of
      the twelve if I had my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at the bare trees. Her expression was a delightful mixture
      of amusement, satisfaction, and scepticism. &ldquo;Then you will dine?&rdquo; she said
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; His reaction to high spirits carried him forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice! Shall we fix a day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day? Yes. Yes&mdash;if you like.&rdquo; He hesitated for an instant, then
      again the impulse of the previous moment dominated his other feeling.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;Yes. After all, why not fix it now?&rdquo; With a
      sudden inclination towards amiability he opened his overcoat, thrust his
      hand into an inner pocket, and drew out his engagement-book&mdash;the same
      long, narrow book fitted with two pencils that Loder had scanned so
      interestedly on his first morning at Grosvenor Square. He opened it,
      turning the pages rapidly. &ldquo;What day shall it be? Thursday's full&mdash;and
      Friday&mdash;and Saturday. What a bore!&rdquo; He still talked fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian leaned across. &ldquo;What a sweet book!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But why the blue
      crosses?&rdquo; She touched one of the pages with her gloved finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote jerked the book, then laughed with a touch of embarrassment. &ldquo;Oh,
      the crosses? Merely to remind me that certain 'appointments must be kept.
      You know my beastly memory! But what about the day? Shall we fix the day?&rdquo;
       His voice was in control, but mentally her trivial question had disturbed
      and jarred him. &ldquo;What day shall we say?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Monday in next
      week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lillian glanced up with a faint exclamation of disappointment. &ldquo;How
      horribly faraway!&rdquo; She spoke with engaging petulance, and, leaning forward
      afresh, drew the book from Chilcote's hand. &ldquo;What about to-morrow?&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, turning back a page. &ldquo;Why not to-morrow? I knew I saw a blank
      space.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow! Oh, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; Her voice dropped. It was true that she desired Chilcote's opinion
      on her adventure, for Chilcote's opinion on men and manners had a certain
      bitter shrewdness; but the exercise of her own power added a point to the
      desire. If the matter had ended with the gain or loss of a tete-a-tete
      with him, it is probable that, whatever its utility, she would not have
      pressed it, but the underlying motive was the stronger. Chilcote had been
      a satellite for years, and it was unpleasant that any satellite should
      drop away into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she said again, in a lower and still more effective tone; and,
      lifting her muff, she buried her face in her flowers. &ldquo;I suppose I shall
      have to dine and go to a music-hall with Leonard&mdash;or stay at home by
      myself,&rdquo; she murmured, looking out across the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote glanced over the long, tan-strewn ride. They had made the
      full circuit of the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's tiresome being by one's self,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while he was irresponsive, then slowly his eyes returned to her
      face. He watched her for a second, and, leaning quickly towards her, he
      took his book and scribbled something in the vacant space.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him interestedly; her face lighted up, and she laid aside her
      muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Jack!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How very sweet of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he held the book towards her, her face fell. &ldquo;Dine 33 Cadogan
      Gardens, 8 o'c. Talk with L.,&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;Why, you've forgotten the
      essential thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up. &ldquo;The essential thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;The blue cross,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isn't it worth even a little
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone was very soft. Chilcote yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the blue pencil,&rdquo; he said, in sudden response to her mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up in quiet pleasure at her Success, and, with a charming
      affectation of seriousness, marked the engagement with a big cross. At the
      same moment the car slackened speed, as the chauffeur waited for further
      orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian shut the engagement-book and handed it back. &ldquo;Where can I drop
      you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;At the club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question recalled him to a sense of present things. He thrust the book
      into his pocket and glanced about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had paused by Hyde Park corner. The crowd of horses and carriages had
      thinned as the hour of lunch drew near, and the wide roadway of the park
      had an air of added space. The suggested loneliness affected him. The tall
      trees, still bereft of leaves, and the colossal gateway incomprehensively
      stirred the sense of mental panic that sometimes seized him in face of
      vastness of space or of architecture. In one moment, Lillian, the
      appointment he had just made, the manner of its making&mdash;all left him.
      The world was filled with his own personality, his own immediate
      inclinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't bother about me!&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;I can get out here. You've
      been very good. It's been a delightful morning.&rdquo; With a hurried pressure
      of her fingers he rose and stepped from the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the ground, he paused for a moment and raised his hat; then,
      without a second glance, he turned and walked rapidly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian sat watching him meditatively. She saw him pass through the
      gateway, saw him hail a hansom, then she remembered the waiting chauffeur.

    <h2>
      XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the same day that Chilcote had parted with Lillian&mdash;but at three
      o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;Loder, dressed in Chilcote's clothes and
      with Chilcote's heavy overcoat slung over his arm, walked from Fleet
      Street to Grosvenor Square. He walked steadily, neither slowly nor yet
      fast. The elation of his last journey over the same ground was tempered by
      feelings he could not satisfactorily bracket even to himself. There was
      less of vehement elation and more of matured determination in his gait and
      bearing than there had been on that night, though the incidents of which
      they were the outcome were very complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Chilcote's house he passed up-stairs; but, still following the
      routine of his previous return, he did not halt at Chilcote's door, but
      moved onward towards Eve's sitting-room and there paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that pause his numberless irregular thoughts fused into one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the same undefined sense of standing upon sacred ground that had
      touched him on the previous occasion, but the outcome of the sensation was
      different. This time he raised his hand almost immediately and tapped on
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, but no voice responded to his knock. With a sense of
      disappointment he knocked again; then, pressing his determination still
      further, he turned the handle and entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      No private room is without meaning&mdash;whether trivial or the reverse.
      In a room, perhaps more even than in speech, in look, or in work, does the
      impress of the individual make itself felt. There, on the wax of outer
      things, the inner self imprints its seal-enforces its fleeting claim to
      separate individuality. This thought, with its arresting interest, made
      Loder walk slowly, almost seriously, half-way across the room and then
      pause to study his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was of medium size&mdash;not too large for comfort and not too
      small for ample space. At a first impression it struck him as unlike any
      anticipation of a woman's sanctum. The walls panelled in dark wood; the
      richly bound books; the beautifully designed bronze ornaments; even the
      flowers, deep crimson and violet-blue in tone, had an air of sombre
      harmony that was scarcely feminine. With a strangely pleasant impression
      he realized this, and, following his habitual impulse, moved slowly
      forward towards the fireplace and there paused, his elbow resting on the
      mantel-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely settled comfortably into his position, scarcely entered on
      his second and more comprehensive study of the place, than the arrangement
      of his mind was altered by the turning of the handle and the opening of
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer was Eve herself. She was dressed in outdoor clothes, and
      walked into the room quickly; then, as Loder had done, she too paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gesture, so natural and spontaneous, had a peculiar attraction; as she
      glanced up at him, her face alight with inquiry, she seemed
      extraordinarily much the owner and designer of her surroundings. She was
      framed by them as naturally and effectively as her eyes and her face were
      framed by her black hair. For one moment he forgot that his presence
      demanded explanation; the next she had made explanation needless. She had
      been looking at him intently; now she came forward slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John?&rdquo; she said, half in appeal, half in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a step towards her. &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he said, quietly and
      involuntarily. In the sharp desire to establish himself in her regard he
      forgot that her eyes had never left his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the incongruity of the words did not strike her. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I believe I <i>knew</i>, directly I saw you here.&rdquo; The quick ring
      of life vibrating in her tone surprised him. But he had other thoughts
      more urgent than surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the five days of banishment just lived through, the need for a
      readjustment of his position with regard to her had come to him forcibly.
      The memory of the night when weakness and he had been at perilously close
      quarters had returned to him persistently and uncomfortably, spoiling the
      remembrance of his triumph. It had been well enough to smother the thought
      of that night in days of work. But had the ignoring of it blotted out the
      weakness? Had it not rather thrown it into bolder relief? A man strong in
      his own strength does not turn his back upon temptation; he faces and
      quells it. In the solitary days in Clifford's Inn, in the solitary
      night-hours spent in tramping the city streets, this had been the
      conviction that had recurred again and again, this the problem to which,
      after much consideration, he had found a solution&mdash;satisfactory at
      least to himself. When next Chilcote called him&mdash;It was notable that
      he had used the word &ldquo;when&rdquo; and not &ldquo;if.&rdquo; When next Chilcote called him he
      would make a new departure. He would no longer avoid Eve; he would
      successfully prove to himself that one interest and one alone filled his
      mind&mdash;the pursuance of Chilcote's political career. So does man
      satisfactorily convince himself against himself. He had this intention
      fully in mind as he came forward now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;has it been very hard to have faith&mdash;these
      last five days?&rdquo; It was not precisely the tone he had meant to adopt; but
      one must begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve turned at his words. Her eyes were brimming with life, her cheeks
      still touched to a deep, soft color by the keenness of the wintry air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with a shy, responsive touch of confidence. &ldquo;I seemed
      to keep on believing. You know converts make the best devotees.&rdquo; She
      laughed with slight embarrassment, and glanced up at him. Something in the
      blue of her eyes reminded him unexpectedly of spring skies&mdash;full of
      youth and promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved abruptly, and crossed the room towards the window. &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he
      said, without looking round, &ldquo;I want your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the faint rustling of her dress as she turned towards him, and he
      knew that he had struck the right chord. All true women respond to an
      appeal for aid as steel answers to the magnet. He could feel her
      expectancy in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know&mdash;we all know&mdash;that the present moment is very vital.
      That it's impossible to deny the crisis in the air. Nobody feels it more
      than I do&mdash;nobody is more exorbitantly keen to have a share&mdash;a
      part, when the real fight comes&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped; then he turned slowly
      and their eyes met. &ldquo;If a man is to succeed in such a desire,&rdquo; he went on,
      deliberately, &ldquo;he must exclude all others&mdash;he must have one purpose,
      one interest, one thought. He must forget that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve lifted her head quickly. &ldquo;&mdash;that he has a wife,&rdquo; she finished,
      gently. &ldquo;I think I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no annoyance in her face or voice, no suggestion of selfishness
      or of hurt vanity. She had read his meaning with disconcerting clearness,
      and responded with disconcerting generosity. A sudden and very human
      dissatisfaction with his readjustment scheme fell upon Loder. Opposition
      is the whip to action; a too-ready acquiescence the slackened rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say that?&rdquo; he asked, quickly. The tone was almost Chilcote's.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up; then a sudden, incomprehensible smile lighted up her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't say, but you thought,&rdquo; she answered, gravely. &ldquo;Thoughts are
      the same as words to a woman. That's why we are so unreasonable.&rdquo; Again
      she smiled. Some idea, baffling and incomprehensible to Loder, was
      stirring in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of the impression, he moved still nearer. &ldquo;You jump to
      conclusions,&rdquo; he said, abruptly. &ldquo;What I meant to imply&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;was precisely what I've understood.&rdquo; Again she finished his
      sentence. Then she laughed softly. &ldquo;How very wise, but how very, very
      foolish men are! You come to the conclusion that because a woman is&mdash;is
      interested in you she is going to hamper you in some direction, and after
      infinite pains you summon all your tact and you set about saving the
      situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was interest, even a touch of amusement, in her tone, her eyes were
      still fixed upon his in an indefinable glance. &ldquo;You think you are being
      very diplomatic,&rdquo; she went on, quietly, &ldquo;but in reality you are being very
      transparent. The woman reads the whole of your meaning in your very first
      sentence&mdash;if she hasn't known it before you began to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder made an interruption, but again she checked him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
      said, still smiling. &ldquo;You should never attempt such a task. Shall I tell
      you why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood silent, puzzled and interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, quickly, &ldquo;when a woman really is&mdash;interested,
      the man's career ranks infinitely higher in her eyes than any personal
      desire for power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment their eyes met, then abruptly Loder looked away. She had
      gauged his intentions incorrectly, yet with disconcerting insight. Again
      the suggestion of an unusual personality below the serenity of her manner
      recurred to his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an impulse altogether foreign to him he lifted his head and again met
      her glance. Then at last he spoke, but only two words. &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; he
      said, with simple, direct sincerity.

    <h2>
      XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      After his interview with Eve, Loder retired to the study and spent the
      remaining hours of the day and the whole span of the evening in work. At
      one o'clock, still feeling fresh in mind and body, he dismissed Greening
      and passed into Chilcote's bedroom. The interview with Eve, though widely
      different from the one he had anticipated, had left him stimulated and
      alert. In the hours that followed it there had been an added anxiety to
      put his mind into harness, an added gratification in finding it answer to
      the rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant sense of retrospection settled upon him as he slowly undressed;
      and a pleasant sense of interest touched him as, crossing to the
      dressing-table, he caught sight of Chilcote's engagement-book&mdash;taken
      with other things from the suit he had changed at dinner-time and
      carefully laid aside by Renwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked it up and slowly turned the pages. It always held the suggestion
      of a lottery&mdash;this dipping into another man's engagements and drawing
      a prize or a blank. It was a sensation that even custom had not dulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he turned the pages slowly, then by degrees his fingers
      quickened. Beyond the fact that this present evening was free, he knew
      nothing of his promised movements. The abruptness of Chilcote's arrival at
      Clifford's Inn in the afternoon had left no time for superfluous
      questions. He skimmed the writing with a touch of interested haste, then
      all at once he paused and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big enough for a tombstone!&rdquo; he said below his breath as his eyes rested
      on a large blue cross. Then he smiled again and held the book to the
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dine 33 Cadogan Gardens, 8 o'c. Talk with L,&rdquo; he read, still speaking
      softly to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment pondering on the entry, then once more his glance
      reverted to the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently meant it to be seen,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;but why the deuce isn't he
      more explicit?&rdquo; As he spoke, a look of comprehension suddenly crossed his
      face and the puzzled frown between his eyebrows cleared away.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a feeling of satisfaction he remembered Lakely's frequent and
      pressing suggestion that he should dine with him at Cadogan Gardens and
      discuss the political outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lakely must have written during his absence, and Chilcote, having marked
      the engagement, felt no further responsibility. The invitation could
      scarcely have been verbal, as Chilcote, he knew, had lain very low in the
      five days of his return home.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he argued, as he stood with the book still open in his hands, the blue
      cross staring imperatively from the white paper. And from the argument
      rose thoughts and suggestions that seethed in his mind long after the
      lights had been switched off, long after the fire had died down and he had
      been left wrapped in darkness in the great canopied bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that he took his second false step. Once during the
      press of the next morning's work it crossed his mind to verify his
      convictions by a glance at the directory. But for once the strong wish
      that evolves a thought conquered his caution. His work was absorbing; the
      need of verification seemed very small. He let the suggestion pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o'clock he dressed carefully. His mind was full of Lakely and of
      the possibilities the night might hold; for more than once before, the
      weight of the 'St. George's Gazette', with Lakely at its back, had turned
      the political scales. To be marked by him as a coming man was at any time
      a favorable portent; to be singled out by him at the present juncture was
      momentous. A thrill of expectancy, almost of excitement, passed through
      him as he surveyed his appearance preparatory to leaving the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing down-stairs, he moved at once to the hall door; but almost as his
      hand touched it he halted, attracted by a movement on the landing above
      him. Turning, he saw Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing quite still, looking down upon him as she had looked once
      before. As their eyes met, she changed her position hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going out?&rdquo; she asked. And it struck Loder quickly that there was
      a suggestion, a shadow of disappointment in the tone of her voice. Moved
      by the impression, he responded with unusual promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm dining out&mdash;dining with Lakely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched him intently while he spoke; then, as the meaning of his words
      reached her, her whole face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mr. Lakely?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, I'm glad&mdash;very glad. It is quite&mdash;quite
      another step.&rdquo; She smiled with a warm, impulsive touch of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, looking up at her, felt his senses stir. At sound of her words his
      secret craving for success quickened to stronger life. The man whose sole
      incentive lies within may go forward coldly and successfully; but the man
      who grasps a double inspiration, who, even unconsciously, is impelled by
      another force, has a stronger impetus for attack, a surer, more vital
      hewing power. Still watching her, he answered instinctively&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;a long step.&rdquo; And, with a smile of farewell, he
      turned, opened the door, and passed into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrill of that one moment was still warm as he reached Cadogan Gardens
      and mounted the steps of No. 33&mdash;so vitally warm that he paused for
      an instant before pressing the electric bell. Then at last, dominated by
      anticipation, he turned and raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action was abrupt, and it was only as his fingers pressed the bell
      that a certain unexpectedness, a certain want of suitability in the aspect
      of the house, struck him. The door was white, the handle and knocker were
      of massive silver. The first seemed a disappointing index of Lakely's
      private taste, the second a ridiculous temptation to needy humanity. He
      looked again at the number of the house, but it stared back at him
      convincingly. Then the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      So keen was his sense of unfitness that, still trying to fuse his
      impression of Lakely with the idea of silver door-fittings, he stepped
      into the hall without the usual preliminary question. Suddenly realizing
      the necessity, he turned to the servant; but the man forestalled him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come to the white room, sir? And may I take your coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smooth certainty of the man's manner surprised him. It held another
      savor of disappointment&mdash;seeming as little in keeping with the keen,
      business-like Lakely as did the house. Still struggling with his
      impression, he allowed himself to be relieved of his hat and coat and in
      silence ushered up the shallow staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the last step was reached it came to him again to mention his host's
      name; but simultaneously with the suggestion the servant stepped forward
      with a quick, silent movement and threw open a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chilcote!&rdquo; he announced, in a subdued, discreet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder's first impression was of a room that seemed unusually luxurious,
      soft, and shadowed. Then all impression of inanimate things left him
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the fraction of a second he stood in the door-way, while the room
      seemed emptied of everything, except a figure that rose slowly from a
      couch before the fire at sound of Chilcote's name; then, with a calmness
      that to himself seemed incredible, he moved forward into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might, of course, have beaten a retreat and obviated many things; but
      life is full of might-have-beens, and retreat never presents itself
      agreeably to a strong man. His impulse was to face the difficulty, and he
      acted on the impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian had risen slowly; and as he neared her she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she exclaimed, softly. &ldquo;How sweet of you to remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice and words came to him with great distinctness, and as they came
      one uncertainty passed forever from his mind&mdash;the question as to what
      relation she and Chilcote held to each other. With the realization came
      the thought of Eve, and in the midst of his own difficulty his face
      hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian ignored the coldness. Taking his hand, she smiled. &ldquo;You're
      unusually punctual,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But your hands are cold. Come closer to
      the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder was not sensible that his hands were cold, but he suffered himself
      to be drawn forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      One end of the couch was in firelight, the other in shadow. By a fortunate
      arrangement of chance Lillian selected the brighter end for herself and
      offered the other to her guest. With a quick sense of respite he accepted
      it. At least he could sit secure from detection while he temporized with
      fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they sat silent, then Lillian stirred. &ldquo;Won't you smoke?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in the room seemed soft and enervating&mdash;the subdued glow
      of the fire, the smell of roses that hung about the air, and, last of all,
      Lillian's slow, soothing voice. With a sense of oppression he stiffened
      his shoulders and sat straighter in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't think I shall smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved nearer to him. &ldquo;Dear Jack,&rdquo; she said, pleadingly, &ldquo;don't say
      you're in a bad mood. Don't say you want to postpone again.&rdquo; She looked up
      at him and laughed a little in mock consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder was at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another silence followed, while Lillian waited; then she frowned suddenly
      and rose from the couch. Like many indolent people, she possessed a touch
      of obstinacy; and now that her triumph over Chilcote was obtained, now
      that she had vindicated her right to command him, her original purpose
      came uppermost again. Cold or interested, indifferent or attentive, she
      intended to make use of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the fire and stood looking down into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she began, gently, &ldquo;a really amazing thing has happened to me. I
      do so want you to throw some light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fresh pause while she softly smoothed the silk embroidery that
      edged her gown. Then once more she looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I ever tell you,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that I was once in a railway accident
      on a funny little Italian railway, centuries before I met you?&rdquo; She
      laughed softly; and with a pretty air of confidence turned from the fire
      and resumed her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Astrupp had caught a fever in Florence, and I was rushing away for fear
      of the infection, when our stupid little train ran off the rails near
      Pistoria and smashed itself up. Fortunately we were within half a mile of
      a village, so we weren't quite bereft. The village was impossibly like a
      toy village, and the accommodation what one would expect in a Noah's Ark,
      but it was all absolutely picturesque. I put up at the little inn with my
      maid and Ko Ko&mdash;Ko Ko was such a sweet dog&mdash;a white poodle. I
      was tremendously keen on poodles that year.&rdquo; She stopped and looked
      thoughtfully towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to come to the point of the story, Jack, the toy village had a boy
      doll!&rdquo; She laughed again. &ldquo;He was an Englishman&mdash;and the first person
      to come to my rescue on the night of the smash-up. He was staying at the
      Noah's Ark inn; and after that first night I&mdash;he&mdash;we&mdash;Oh,
      Jack, haven't you any imagination?&rdquo; Her voice sounded petulant and sharp.
      The man who is indifferent to the recital of an old love affair implies
      the worst kind of listener. &ldquo;I believe you aren't interested,&rdquo; she added,
      in another and more reproachful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward. &ldquo;You're wrong there,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;I'm deeply
      interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him again. His tone reassured her, but his words left her
      uncertain; Chilcote was rarely emphatic. With a touch of hesitation she
      went on with her tale:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I told you, he was the first to find us&mdash;to find me, I should
      say, for my stupid maid was having hysterics farther up the line, and Ko
      Ko was lost. I remember the first thing I did was to send him in search of
      Ko Ko&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his position, Loder found occasion to smile. &ldquo;Did he
      succeed?&rdquo; he said, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Succeed? Oh yes, he succeeded.&rdquo; She also smiled involuntarily. &ldquo;Poor Ko
      Ko was stowed away under the luggage-van; and after quite a lot of trouble
      he pulled him out. When it was all done the dog was quite unhurt and
      livelier than ever, but the Englishman had his finger almost bitten
      through. Ko Ko was a dear, but his teeth and his temper were both very
      sharp!&rdquo; She laughed once more in soft amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder was silent for a second, then he too laughed&mdash;Chilcote's short,
      sarcastic laugh. &ldquo;And you tied up the wound, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up, half displeased. &ldquo;We were both staying at the little inn,&rdquo;
       she said, as though no further explanation could be needed. Then again her
      manner changed. She moved imperceptibly nearer and touched his right hand.
      His left, which was farther away from her, was well in the shadow of the
      cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she said, caressingly, &ldquo;it isn't to tell you this stupid old story
      that I've brought you here; it's really to tell you a sort of sequel.&rdquo; She
      stroked his hand gently once or twice. &ldquo;As I say, I met this man and we&mdash;we
      had an affair. You understand? Then we quarrelled&mdash;quarrelled quite
      badly&mdash;and I came away. I've remembered him rather longer than I
      remember most people&mdash;he was one of those dogged individuals who
      stick in one's mind. But he has stayed in mine for another reason&mdash;&rdquo;
       Again she looked up. &ldquo;He has stayed because you helped to keep him there.
      You know how I have sometimes put my hands over your mouth and told you
      that your eyes reminded me of some one else? Well, that some one else was
      my Englishman. But you mustn't be jealous; he was a horrid, obstinate
      person, and you&mdash;well, you know what I think of you&mdash;&rdquo; She
      pressed his hand. &ldquo;But to come to the end of the story, I never saw this
      man since that long-ago time, until&mdash;until the night of Blanche's
      party!&rdquo; She spoke slowly, to give full effect to her words; then she
      waited for his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the result was not what she expected. He said nothing; and, with an
      abrupt movement, he drew his hand from between hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you surprised?&rdquo; she asked at last, with a delicate note of
      reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started slightly, as if recalled to the necessity of the moment.
      &ldquo;Surprised?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why should I be surprised? One person more or less
      at a big party isn't astonishing. Besides, you expect a man to turn up
      sooner or later in his own country. Why should I be surprised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lay back luxuriously. &ldquo;Because, my dear boy,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;it's
      a mystery! It's one of those fascinating mysteries that come once in a
      lifetime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder made no movement. &ldquo;You must explain,&rdquo; he said, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian smiled. &ldquo;That's just what I want to do. When I was in my tent on
      the night of Blanche's party, a man came to be gazed for. He came just
      like anybody else, and laid his hands upon the table. He had strong, thin
      hands like&mdash;well, rather like yours But he wore two rings on the
      third finger of his left hand&mdash;a heavy signet-ring and a plain gold
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder moved his hand imperceptibly till the cushion covered it. Lillian's
      words caused him no surprise, scarcely even any trepidation. He felt now
      that he had expected them, even waited for them, all along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him to, take off his rings,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and just for a second
      he hesitated&mdash;I could feel him hesitate; then he seemed to make up
      his mind, for he drew them off. He drew them off, Jack, and guess what I
      saw! Do guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Loder involuntarily drew back into his corner of the
      couch. &ldquo;I never guess,&rdquo; he said, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll tell you. His hands were the hands of my Englishman! The rings
      covered the scar made by Ko Ko's teeth. I knew it instantly&mdash;the
      second my eyes rested on it. It was the same scar that I had bound up
      dozens of times&mdash;that I had seen healed before I left Santasalare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you? What did you do?&rdquo; Loder felt it singularly difficult and
      unpleasant to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's the point. That's where I was stupid and made my mistake. I
      should have spoken to him on the moment, but I didn't. You know how one
      sometimes hesitates. Afterwards it was too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you saw him afterwards&mdash;in the rooms?&rdquo; Loder spoke unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't&mdash;that's the other point. I didn't see him in the rooms,
      and I haven't seen him since. Directly he was gone, I left the tent&mdash;I
      pretended to be hungry and bored; but, though I went through every room,
      he was nowhere to be found. Once&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated and laughed again&mdash;&ldquo;once
      I thought I had found him, but it was only you&mdash;you, as you stood in
      that door-way with your mouth and chin hidden by Leonard Kaine's head.
      Wasn't it a quaint mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an uncertain pause. Then Loder, feeling the need of speech,
      broke the silence suddenly. &ldquo;Where do I come in?&rdquo; he asked abruptly. &ldquo;What
      am I wanted for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To help to throw light on the mystery! I've seen Blanche's list of
      people, and there wasn't a man I couldn't place&mdash;no outsider ever
      squeezes through Blanche's door. I have questioned Bobby Blessington, but
      he can't remember who came to the tent last. And Bobby was supposed to
      have kept count!&rdquo; She spoke in deep scorn; but almost immediately the
      scorn faded and she smiled again. &ldquo;Now that I've explain ed, Jack,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;what do you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time Loder knew what his presence in the room really
      meant; and at best the knowledge was disconcerting. It is not every day
      that a man is called upon to unearth himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suggest?&rdquo; he repeated, blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I'd rather have your idea of the affair than anybody else's. You are
      so dear and sarcastic and keen that you can't help getting straight at the
      middle of a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lillian wanted anything she could be very sweet. She suddenly dropped
      her half-petulant tone; she suddenly ceased to be a spoiled child. With a
      perfectly graceful movement she drew quite close to Loder and slid gently
      to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an attitude that few women can safely assume; it requires all the
      attributes of youth, suppleness, and a certain buoyant ease. But Lillian
      never acted without justification, and as she leaned towards Loder her
      face lifted, her slight figure and pale hair softened by the firelight,
      she made a picture that it would have been difficult to criticise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the person who should have appreciated it stared steadily beyond it to
      the fire. His mind was absorbed by one question&mdash;the question of how
      he might reasonably leave the house before discovery became assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian, attentively watchful of him, saw the uneasy look, and her own
      face fell. But, as she looked, an inspiration came to her&mdash;a
      remembrance of many interviews with Chilcote smoothed and facilitated by
      the timely use of tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;before you say another word I insist on your
      lighting a cigarette.&rdquo; She leaned forward. resting against his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her words Loder's eyes left the fire. His attention was suddenly needed
      for a new and more imminent difficulty. &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;I
      have no wish to smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a matter of what you wish but of what I say.&rdquo; She smiled. She
      knew that Chilcote with a cigarette between his lips was infinitely more
      tractable than Chilcote sitting idle, and she had no intention of ignoring
      the knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder caught at her words. &ldquo;Before you ordered me to smoke,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;you told me to give you some advice. Your first command must have prior
      claim.&rdquo; He grasped unhesitatingly at the less risky theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him. &ldquo;You're always nicer when you smoke,&rdquo; she persisted,
      caressingly. &ldquo;Light a cigarette&mdash;and give me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder's mouth became set. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we'll stick to this advice
      business. It interests me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, now. You want to find out why this Englishman from Italy was at your
      sister's party, and why he disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are times when a malignant obstinacy seems to affect certain people.
      The only answer Lillian made was to pass her hand over Loder's waistcoat,
      and, feeling his cigarette-case, to draw it from the pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      He affected not to see it. &ldquo;Do you think he recognized you in that tent?&rdquo;
       he insisted, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out the case. &ldquo;Here are your cigarettes. You know we're always
      more social when we smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the short interval while she looked up into his face several ideas
      passed through Loder's mind. He thought of standing up suddenly and so
      regaining his advantage; he wondered quickly whether one hand could
      possibly suffice for the taking out and lighting of two cigarettes. Then
      all need for speculation was pushed suddenly aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian, looking into his face, saw his fresh look of disturbance, and
      from long experience again changed her tactics. Laying the cigarette-case
      on the couch, she put one hand on his shoulder, the other on his left arm.
      Hundreds of times this caressing touch had quieted Chilcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old boy!&rdquo; she said, soothingly, her hand moving slowly down his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash of understanding the consequences of this position came to him.
      Action was imperative, at whatever risk. With an abrupt gesture he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement was awkward. He got to his feet precipitately; Lillian drew
      back, surprised and startled, catching involuntarily at his left hand to
      steady her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers grasped at, then held his. He made no effort to release them.
      With a dogged acknowledgment, he admitted himself worsted.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long she stayed immovable, holding his hand, neither of them knew. The
      process of a woman's instinct is so subtle, so obscure, that it would be
      futile to apply to it the commonplace test of time. She kept her hold
      tenaciously, as though his fingers possessed some peculiar virtue; then at
      last she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rings, Jack?&rdquo; she said, very slowly. And under the two short words a
      whole world of incredulity and surmise made itself felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound she dropped his hand and rose from her knees. What her
      suspicions, what her instincts were she could not have clearly defined,
      but her action was unhesitating. Without a moment's uncertainty she turned
      to the fireplace, pressed the electric button, and flooded the room with
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no force so demoralizing as unexpected light. Loder took a step
      backward, his hand hanging unguarded by his side; and Lillian, stepping
      forward, caught it again before he could protest. Lifting it quickly, she
      looked scrutinizingly at the two rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      All women jump to conclusions, and it is extraordinary how seldom they
      jump short. Seeing only what Lillian saw, knowing only what she knew, no
      man would have staked a definite opinion; but the other sex takes a
      different view. As she stood gazing at the rings her thoughts and her
      conclusions sped through her mind like arrows&mdash;all aimed and all
      tending towards one point. She remembered the day when she and Chilcote
      had talked of doubles, her scepticism and his vehement defence of the
      idea; his sudden interest in the book 'Other Men's Shoes', and his
      anathema against life and its irksome round of duties. She remembered her
      own first convinced recognition of the eyes that had looked at her in the
      doorway of her sister's house; and, last of all, she remembered Chilcote's
      unaccountable avoidance of the same subject of likenesses when she had
      mentioned it yesterday driving through the Park&mdash;and with it his
      unnecessarily curt repudiation of his former opinions. She reviewed each
      item, then she raised her head slowly and looked at Loder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was prepared for the glance and met it steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long moment that her eyes searched his face it was she and not he
      who changed color. She was the first to speak. &ldquo;You were the man whose
      hands I saw in the tent,&rdquo; she said. She made the statement in her usual
      soft tones, but a slight tremor of excitement underran her voice. Poodles,
      Persian kittens, even crystal gazing-balls, seemed very far away in face
      of this tangible, fabulous, present interest. &ldquo;You are not Jack Chilcote,&rdquo;
       she said, very slowly. &ldquo;You are wearing his clothes, and speaking in his
      voice but you are not Jack Chilcote.&rdquo; Her tone quickened with a touch of
      excitement. &ldquo;You needn't keep silent and look at me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know
      quite well what I am saying&mdash;though I don't understand it, though I
      have no real proof&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, momentarily disconcerted by her
      companion's silent and steady gaze, and in the pause a curious and
      unexpected thing occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed suddenly&mdash;a full, confident, reassured laugh. All the
      web that the past half-hour had spun about him, all the intolerable sense
      of an impending crash, lifted suddenly. He saw his way clearly&mdash;and
      it was Lillian who had opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still looking at her, he smiled&mdash;a smile of reliant determination,
      such as Chilcote had never worn in his life. And with a calm gesture he
      released his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest charm of woman is her imagination,&rdquo; he said, quietly.
      &ldquo;Without it there would be no color in life; we would come into and drop
      out of it with the same uninteresting tone of drab reality.&rdquo; He paused and
      smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his smile, Lillian involuntarily drew back, the color deepening in her
      cheeks. &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head. With each moment he felt more certain of himself.
      &ldquo;Because that is my attitude,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As a man I admire your
      imagination, but as a man I fail to follow your reasoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words and the tone both stung her. &ldquo;Do you realize the position?&rdquo; she
      asked, sharply. &ldquo;Do you realize that, whatever your plans are, I can spoil
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder still met her eyes. &ldquo;I realize nothing of the sort,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you admit that you are not Jack Chilcote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neither deny nor admit. My identity is obvious. I can get twenty men to
      swear to it at any moment that you like. The fact that I haven't worn
      rings till now will scarcely interest them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do admit&mdash;to me, that you are not Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny nothing&mdash;and admit nothing. I still offer my
      congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same possession&mdash;your imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lillian stamped her foot. Then, by a quick effort, she conquered her
      temper. &ldquo;Prove me to be wrong!&rdquo; she said, with a fresh touch of
      excitement. &ldquo;Take off your rings and let me see your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a deliberate gesture Loder put his hand behind his back. &ldquo;I never
      gratify childish curiosity,&rdquo; he said, with another smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a flash of temper crossed her eyes. &ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
      it's quite wise to talk like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed again. &ldquo;Is that a threat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's an empty one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before replying he waited a moment, looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conclude,&rdquo; he began, quietly, &ldquo;that your idea is to spread this wild,
      improbable story&mdash;to ask people to believe that John Chilcote, whom
      they see before them, is not John Chilcote, but somebody else. Now you'll
      find that a harder task than you imagine. This is a sceptical world, and
      people are absurdly fond of their own eyesight. We are all journalists
      nowadays&mdash;we all want facts. The first thing you will be asked for is
      your proof. And what does your proof consist of? The circumstance that
      John Chilcote, who has always despised jewelry, has lately taken to
      wearing rings! Your own statement, unattended by any witnesses, that with
      those rings off his finger bears a scar belonging to another man! No; on
      close examination I scarcely imagine that your case would hold.&rdquo; He
      stopped, fired by his own logic. The future might be Chilcote's but the
      present was his; and this present&mdash;with its immeasurable
      possibilities&mdash;had been rescued from catastrophe. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
      again. &ldquo;When you get your proof perhaps we'll have another talk; but till
      then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till then?&rdquo; She looked up quickly; but almost at once her question died
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door had opened, and the servant who had admitted Loder stood in the
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner is served!&rdquo; he announced, in his deferential voice.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      And Loder dined with Lillian Astrupp. We live in an age when society
      expects, even exacts, much. He dined, not through bravado and not through
      cowardice, but because it seemed the obvious, the only thing to do. To him
      a scene of any description was distasteful; to Lillian it was unknown. In
      her world people loved or hated, were spiteful or foolish, were even
      quixotic or dishonorable, but they seldom made scenes. Loder tacitly saw
      and tacitly accepted this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly they ate extremely little during the course of the dinner, and
      talked extraordinarily much on subjects that interested neither; but the
      main point at least was gained. They dined. The conventionalities were
      appeased; the silent, watchful servants who waited on them were given no
      food for comment. The fact that Loder left immediately after dinner, the
      fact that he paused on the door-step after the hall door had closed behind
      him, and drew a long, deep breath of relief, held only an individual
      significance and therefore did not count.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Chilcote's house he passed at once to the study and dismissed
      Greening for the night. But scarcely had he taken advantage of his
      solitude by settling into an arm-chair and lighting a cigar, than Renwick,
      displaying an unusual amount of haste and importance, entered the room
      carrying a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Loder, he came forward at once. &ldquo;Mr. Fraide's man brought this,
      sir,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He was most particular to give it into my hands&mdash;making
      sure 'twould reach you. He's waiting for an answer, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder rose and took the letter, a quick thrill of speculation and interest
      springing across his mind. During his time of banishment he had followed
      the political situation with feverish attention, insupportably chafed by
      the desire to share in it, apprehensively chilled at the thought of
      Chilcote's possible behavior. He knew that in the comparatively short
      interval since Parliament had risen no act of aggression had marked the
      Russian occupation of Meshed, but he also knew that Fraide and his
      followers looked askance at that great power's amiable attitude, and at
      sight of his leader's message his intuition stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the nearest lamp, he tore the envelope open and scanned the
      letter anxiously. It was written in Fraide's own clear, somewhat
      old-fashioned writing, and opened with a kindly rebuke for his desertion
      of him since the day of his speech; then immediately, and with
      characteristic clearness, it opened up the subject nearest the writer's
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very slowly and attentively Loder read the letter; and with the extreme
      quiet that with him invariably covered emotion, he moved to the desk,
      wrote a note, and handed it to the waiting servant. As the man turned
      towards the door he called him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Renwick!&rdquo; he said, sharply, &ldquo;when you've given that letter to Mr.
      Fraide's servant, ask Mrs. Chilcote if she can spare me five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Renwick had gone and closed the door behind him, Loder paced the room
      with feverish activity. In one moment the aspect of life had been changed.
      Five minutes since he had been glorying in the risk of a barely saved
      situation; now that situation with its merely social complications had
      become a matter of small importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His long, striding steps had carried him to the fireplace, and his back
      was towards the door when at last the handle turned. He wheeled round to
      receive Eve's message; then a look of pleased surprise crossed his face.
      It was Eve herself who stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without hesitation his lips parted. &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, abruptly, &ldquo;I have had
      great news! Russia has shown her teeth at last. Two caravans belonging to
      a British trader were yesterday interfered with by a band of Cossacks. The
      affair occurred a couple of miles outside Meshed; the traders
      remonstrated, but the Russians made summary use of their advantage. Two
      Englishmen were wounded and one of them has since died. Fraide has only
      now received the news&mdash;which cannot be overrated. It gives the
      precise lever necessary for the big move at the reassembling.&rdquo; He spoke
      with great earnestness and unusual haste. As he finished he took a step
      forward. &ldquo;But that's not all!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Fraide wants the great move set
      in motion by a great speech&mdash;and he has asked me to make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Eve waited. She looked at him in silence; and in that silence
      he read in her eyes the reflection of his own expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she asked, in a suppressed voice. &ldquo;What answer did you give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her for an instant, taking a strange pleasure in her flushed
      face and brilliantly eager eyes; then the joy of conscious strength, the
      sense of opportunity regained, swept all other considerations out of
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accepted,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;Could any man who was merely human have
      done otherwise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was Loder's attitude and action on the night of his jeopardy and his
      success, and the following day found his mood unchanged. He was one of
      those rare individuals who never give a promise overnight and regret it in
      the morning. He was slow to move, but when he did the movement brushed all
      obstacles aside. In the first days of his usurpation he had gone
      cautiously, half fascinated, half distrustful; then the reality, the
      extraordinary tangibility of the position had gripped him when, matching
      himself for the first time with men of his own caliber, he had learned his
      real weight on the day of his protest against the Easter adjournment. With
      that knowledge had been born the dominant factor in his whole scheme&mdash;the
      overwhelming, insistent desire to manifest his power. That desire that is
      the salvation or the ruin of every strong man who has once realized his
      strength. Supremacy was the note to which his ambition reached. To trample
      out Chilcote's footmarks with his own had been his tacit instinct from the
      first; now it rose paramount. It was the whole theory of creation&mdash;the
      survival of the fittest&mdash;the deep, egotistical certainty that he was
      the better man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was with this conviction that he entered on the vital period of his
      dual career. The imminent crisis, and his own share in it, absorbed him
      absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the weeks that followed his answer to Fraide's proposal he gave himself
      ungrudgingly to his work. He wrote, read, and planned with tireless
      energy; he frequently forgot to eat, and slept only through sheer
      exhaustion; in the fullest sense of the word he lived for the culminating
      hour that was to bring him failure or success.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seldom left Grosvenor Square in the days that followed, except to
      confer with his party. All his interest, all his relaxation even, lay in
      his work and what pertained to it. His strength was like a solid wall, his
      intelligence was sharp and keen as steel. The moment was his; and by sheer
      mastery of will he put other considerations out of sight. He forgot
      Chilcote and forgot Lillian&mdash;not because they escaped his memory, but
      because he chose to shut them from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Eve he saw but little in this time of high pressure. When a man touches
      the core of his capacities, puts his best into the work that in his eyes
      stands paramount, there is little place for, and no need of, woman. She
      comes before&mdash;and after. She inspires, compensates, or completes; but
      the achievement, the creation, is man's alone. And all true women
      understand and yield to this unspoken precept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve watched the progress of his labor, and in the depth of her own heart
      the watching came nearer to actual living than any activity she had known.
      She was an on-looker&mdash;but an on-looker who stood, as it were, on the
      steps of the arena, who, by a single forward movement, could feel the sand
      under her feet, the breath of the battle on her face; and in this
      knowledge she rested satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were hours when Loder seemed scarcely conscious of her existence;
      but on those occasions she smiled in her serene way&mdash;and went on
      waiting. She knew that each day, before the afternoon had passed, he would
      come into her sitting-room, his face thoughtful, his hands full of books
      or papers, and, dropping into one of the comfortable, studious chairs,
      would ask laconically for tea. This was her moment of triumph and
      recompense&mdash;for the very unconsciousness of his coming doubled its
      value. He would sit for half an hour with a preoccupied glance, or with
      keen, alert eyes fixed on the fire, while his ideas sorted themselves and
      fell into line. Sometimes he was silent for the whole half-hour, sometimes
      he commented to himself as he scanned his notes; but on other and rarer
      occasions he talked, speaking his thoughts and his theories aloud, with
      the enjoyment of a man who knows himself fully in his depth, while Eve
      sipped her tea or stitched peacefully at a strip of embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these occasions she made a perfect listener. Here and there she
      encouraged him with an intelligent remark, but she never interrupted. She
      knew when to be silent and when to speak; when to merge her own
      individuality and when to make it felt. In these days of stress and
      preparation he came to her unconsciously for rest; he treated her as he
      might have treated a younger brother&mdash;relying on her discretion,
      turning to her as by right for sympathy, comprehension, and friendship.
      Sometimes, as they sat silent in the richly colored, homelike room, Eve
      would pause over her embroidery and let her thoughts spin momentarily
      forward&mdash;spin towards the point where, the brunt of his ordeal
      passed, he must, of necessity, seek something beyond mere rest. But there
      her thoughts would inevitably break off and the blood flame quickly into
      her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Loder worked persistently. With each day that brought the crisis
      of Fraide's scheme nearer, his activity increased&mdash;and with it an
      intensifying of the nervous strain. For if he had his hours of exaltation,
      he also had his hours of black apprehension. It is all very well to
      exorcise a ghost by sheer strength of will, but one has also to eliminate
      the idea that gave it existence. Lillian Astrupp, with her unattested
      evidence and her ephemeral interest, gave him no real uneasiness; but
      Chilcote and Chilcote's possible summons were matters of graver
      consideration; and there were times when they loomed very dark and
      sinister: What if at the very moment of fulfilment&mdash;? But invariably
      he snapped the thread of the supposition and turned with fiercer ardor to
      his work of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the last morning of his probation dawned, and for the first time he
      breathed freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose early on the day that was to witness his great effort and dressed
      slowly. It was a splendid morning; the spirit of the spring seemed
      embodied in the air, in the pale-blue sky, in the shafts of cool sunshine
      that danced from the mirror to the dressing-table, from the dressing-table
      to the pictures on the walls of Chilcote's vast room. Inconsequently with
      its dancing rose a memory of the distant past&mdash;a memory of
      long-forgotten days when, as a child, he had been bidden to watch the same
      sun perform the same fantastic evolutions. The sight and the thought
      stirred him curiously with an unlooked-for sense of youth. He drew himself
      together with an added touch of decision as he passed out into the
      corridor; and as he walked down-stairs he whistled a bar or two of an
      inspiriting tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning-room Eve was already waiting. She looked up, colored, and
      smiled as he entered. Her face looked very fresh and young and she wore a
      gown of the same pale blue that she had worn on his first coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up from an open letter as he came into the room, and the sun
      that fell through the window caught her in a shaft of light, intensifying
      her blue eyes, her blue gown, and the bunch of violets fastened in her
      belt. To Loder, still under the influence of early memories, she seemed
      the embodiment of some youthful ideal&mdash;something lost, sought for,
      and found again. Realization of his feeling for her almost came to him as
      he stood there looking at her. It hovered about him; it tipped him, as it
      were, with its wings; then it rose again and soared away. Men like him&mdash;men
      keen to grasp an opening where their careers are concerned, and tenacious
      to hold it when once grasped&mdash;are frequently the last to look into
      their own hearts. He glanced at Eve, he acknowledged the stir of his
      feeling, but he made no attempt to define its cause. He could no more have
      given reason for his sensations than he could have told the precise date
      upon which, coming down-stairs at eight o'clock, he had first found her
      waiting breakfast for him. The time when all such incidents were to stand
      out, each to a nicety in its appointed place, had not yet arrived. For the
      moment his youth had returned to him; he possessed the knowledge of work
      done, the sense of present companionship in a world of agreeable things;
      above all, the steady, quiet conviction of his own capacity. All these
      things came to him in the moment of his entering the room, greeting Eve,
      and passing to the breakfast-table; then, while his eyes still rested
      contentedly on the pleasant array of china and silver, while his senses
      were still alive to the fresh, earthly scent of Eve's violets, the blow so
      long dreaded&mdash;so slow in coming fell with accumulated force.

    <h2>
      XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The letter through which the blow fell was not voluminous. It was written
      on cheap paper in a disguised hand, and the contents covered only half a
      page. Loder read it slowly, mentally articulating every word; then he laid
      it down, and as he did so he caught Eve's eyes raised in concern. Again he
      saw something of his own feelings reflected in her face, and the shock
      braced him; he picked up the letter, tearing it into strips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go out,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;I must go now&mdash;at once.&rdquo; His voice
      was hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve's surprised, concerned eyes still searched his. &ldquo;Now&mdash;at once?&rdquo;
       she repeated. &ldquo;Now&mdash;without breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not hungry.&rdquo; He rose from his seat, and, carrying the slips of paper
      across the room, dropped them into the fire. He did it, not so much from
      caution, as from an imperative wish to do something, to move, if only
      across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve's glance followed him. &ldquo;Is it bad news?&rdquo; she asked, anxiously. It was
      unlike her to be insistent, but she was moved to the impulse by the
      peculiarity of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;It's&mdash;business. This was written yesterday; I
      should have got it last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes widened. &ldquo;But nobody does business at eight in the morning&mdash;&rdquo;
       she began, in astonishment; then she suddenly broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without apology or farewell, Loder had left the fireplace and walked out
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the hall hurriedly, picking up a hat as he went; and,
      reaching the pavement outside, he went straight forward until Grosvenor
      Square was left behind; then he ran. At the risk of reputation, at the
      loss of dignity, he ran until he saw a cab. Hailing it, he sprang inside,
      and, as the cabman whipped up and the horse responded to the call, he
      realized for the first time the full significance of what had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Realization, like the need for action, came to him slowly, but when it
      came it was with terrible lucidity. He did not swear as he leaned back in
      his seat, mechanically watching the stream of men on their way to
      business, the belated cars of green produce blocking the way between the
      Strand and Covent Garden. He had no use for oaths; his feelings lay deeper
      than mere words. But his mouth was sternly set and his eyes looked cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the Law Courts he dismissed his cab and walked forward to
      Clifford's Inn. As he passed through the familiar entrance a chill fell on
      him. In the clear, early light it seemed more than ever a place of dead
      hopes, dead enterprises, dead ambitions. In the onward march of life it
      had been forgotten. The very air had a breath of unfulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the court rapidly, but his mouth set itself afresh as he passed
      through the door-way of his own house and crossed the bare hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he mounted the well-known stairs, he received his first indication of
      life in the appearance of a cat from the second-floor rooms. At sight of
      him, the animal came forward, rubbed demonstratively against his legs, and
      with affectionate persistence followed him up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside his door he paused. On the ground stood the usual morning can of
      milk&mdash;evidence that Chilcote was not yet awake or that, like himself,
      he had no appetite for breakfast. He smiled ironically as the idea struck
      him, but it was a smile that stiffened rather than relaxed his lips. Then
      he drew out the duplicate key he always carried, and, inserting it
      quietly, opened the door. A close, unpleasant smell greeted him as he
      entered the small passage that divided the bed and sitting rooms&mdash;a
      smell of whiskey mingling with the odor of stale smoke. With a quick
      gesture he pushed open the bedroom door; then on the threshold he paused,
      a look of contempt and repulsion passing over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his first glance he scarcely grasped the details of the scene, for the
      half-drawn curtains kept the light dim, but as his eyes grew accustomed to
      the obscurity he gathered their significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room had a sleepless, jaded air&mdash;the room that under his own
      occupation had shown a rigid, almost monastic severity. The plain
      dressing-table was littered with cigarette ends and marked with black and
      tawny patches where the tobacco had been left to burn itself out. On one
      corner of the table a carafe of water and a whiskey-decanter rested one
      against the other, as if for support, and at the other end an overturned
      tumbler lay in a pool of liquid. The whole effect was sickly and
      nauseating. His glance turned involuntarily to the bed, and there halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the hard, narrow mattress, from which the sheets and blankets had
      fallen in a disordered heap, lay Chilcote. He was fully dressed in a
      shabby tweed suit of Loder's; his collar was open, his lip and chin
      unshaven; one hand was limply grasping the pillow, while the other hung
      out over the side of the bed. His face, pale, almost earthy in hue, might
      have been a mask, save for the slight convulsive spasms that crossed it
      from time to time, and corresponded with the faint, shivering starts that
      passed at intervals over his whole body. To complete his repellent
      appearance, a lock of hair had fallen loose and lay black and damp across
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder stood for a space shocked and spellbound by the sight. Even in the
      ghastly disarray, the likeness&mdash;the extraordinary, sinister likeness
      that had become the pivot upon which he himself revolved&mdash;struck him
      like a blow. The man who lay there was himself-bound to him by some
      subtle, inexplicable tie of similarity. As the idea touched him he turned
      aside and stepped quickly to the dressing-table; there, with unnecessary
      energy, he flung back the curtains and threw the window wide; then again
      he turned towards the bed. He had one dominant impulse&mdash;to waken
      Chilcote, to be free of the repulsive, inert presence that chilled him
      with so personal a horror. Leaning over the bed, he caught the shoulder
      nearest to him and shook it. It was not the moment for niceties, and his
      gesture was rough.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his first touch Chilcote made no response&mdash;his brain, dulled by
      indulgence in his vice, had become a laggard in conveying sensations; but
      at last, as the pressure on his shoulder increased, his nervous system
      seemed suddenly to jar into consciousness. A long shudder shook him; he
      half lifted himself and then dropped back upon the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a trembling breath. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The sound seemed drawn
      from him by compulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its uncanny tone chilled Loder anew. &ldquo;Wake up, man!&rdquo; he said, suddenly.
      &ldquo;Wake up! It's I&mdash;Loder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the other shuddered; then he turned quickly and nervously. &ldquo;Loder?&rdquo;
       he said, doubtfully. &ldquo;Loder?&rdquo; Then his face changed. &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;what a relief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were so intense, so spontaneous and unexpected, that Loder took
      a step back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote laughed discordantly, and lifted a shaky hand to protect his eyes
      from the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's all right, Loder! It's all right! It's only that I&mdash;that
      I had a beastly dream. But, for Heaven's sake, shut that window!&rdquo; He
      shivered involuntarily and pushed the lock of damp hair from his forehead
      with a weak touch of his old irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence Loder moved back to the window and shut it. He was affected
      more than he would own even to himself by the obvious change in Chilcote.
      He had seen him moody, restless, nervously excited; but never before had
      he seen him entirely demoralized. With a dull feeling of impotence and
      disgust he stood by the closed window, looking unseeingly at the roofs of
      the opposite houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote had followed his movements restlessly; and now, as he watched
      him, a flicker of excitement crossed his face. &ldquo;God! Loder,&rdquo; he said,
      again, &ldquo;'twas a relief to see you! I dreamed I was in hell&mdash;a
      horrible hell, worse than the one they preach about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed to reassure himself, but his voice shook pitiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, who had come to fight, stood silent and inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was horrible&mdash;beastly,&rdquo; Chilcote went on. &ldquo;There was no fire and
      brimstone, but there was something worse. It was a great ironic scheme of
      punishment by which every man was chained to his own vice&mdash;by which
      the thing he had gone to pieces over, instead of being denied him, was
      made compulsory. You can't imagine it.&rdquo; He shivered nervously and his
      voice rose. &ldquo;Fancy being satiated beyond the limit of satiety, being
      driven and dogged by the thing you had run after all your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused excitedly, and in the pause Loder found resolution. He shut his
      ears to the panic in Chilcote's voice, he closed his consciousness to the
      sight of his shaken face. With a surge of determination he rallied his
      theories. After all, he had himself and his own interests to claim his
      thought. At the moment Chilcote was a wreck, with no desire towards
      rehabilitation; but there was no guarantee that in an hour or two he might
      not have regained control over himself, and with it the inclination that
      had prompted his letter of the day before. No; he had himself to look to.
      The survival of the fittest was the true, the only principle. Chilcote had
      had intellect, education, opportunity, and Chilcote had deliberately cast
      them aside. Fortifying himself in the knowledge, he turned from the window
      and moved slowly back to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you wrote for me last night&mdash;&rdquo; His voice was
      hard; he had come to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote glanced up quickly. His mouth was drawn and there was anew
      anxiety in his eyes. &ldquo;Loder!&rdquo; he exclaimed, quickly. &ldquo;Loder, come here!
      Come nearer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly Loder obeyed. Stepping closer to the side of the bed, he bent
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other put up his hand and caught his arm. His fingers trembled and
      jerked. &ldquo;I say, Loder,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, &ldquo;I&mdash;I've had such a
      beastly night&mdash;my nerves, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a quick, involuntary disgust Loder drew back. &ldquo;Don't you think we
      might shove that aside?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote's gaze had wandered from his face and strayed to the
      dressing-table; there it moved feverishly from one object to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loder,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you see&mdash;can you see if there's a tube of
      tabloids on the mantel-shelf&mdash;or on the dressing-table?&rdquo; He lifted
      himself nervously on his elbow and his eyes wandered uneasily about the
      room. &ldquo;I&mdash;I had a beastly night; my nerves are horribly jarred; and I
      thought&mdash;I think&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his increasing consciousness his nervous collapse became more marked.
      At the first moment of waking, the relief of an unexpected presence had
      surmounted everything else; but now, as one by one his faculties stirred,
      his wretched condition became patent. With a new sense of perturbation
      Loder made his next attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilcote&mdash;&rdquo; he began, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again Chilcote caught his arm, plucking at the coat-sleeve. &ldquo;Where is
      it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where is the tube of tabloids&mdash;the sedative? I'm&mdash;I'm
      obliged to take something when my nerves go wrong&mdash;&rdquo; In his weakness
      and nervous tremor he forgot that Loder was the sharer of his secret. Even
      in his extremity his fear of detection clung to him limply&mdash;the lies
      that had become second nature slipped from him without effort. Then
      suddenly a fresh panic seized him; his fingers tightened spasmodically,
      his eyes ceased to rove about the room and settled on his companion's
      face. &ldquo;Can you see it, Loder?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can't&mdash;the light's in my
      eyes. Can you see it? Can you see the tube?&rdquo; He lifted himself higher, an
      agony of apprehension in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder pushed him back upon the pillow. He was striving hard to keep his
      own mind cool, to steer his own course straight through the chaos that
      confronted him. &ldquo;Chilcote,&rdquo; he began once more, &ldquo;you sent for me last
      night, and I came the first thing this morning to tell you&mdash;&rdquo; But
      there he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an excitement that lent him strength, Chilcote pushed aside his
      hands. &ldquo;God!&rdquo; he said, suddenly, &ldquo;suppose 'twas lost&mdash;suppose 'twas
      gone!&rdquo; The imaginary possibility gripped him. He sat up, his face livid,
      drops of perspiration showing on his forehead, his whole shattered system
      trembling before his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight, Loder set his lips. &ldquo;The tube is on the mantel-shelf,&rdquo; he
      said, in a cold, abrupt voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A groan of relief fell from Chilcote and the muscles of his face relaxed.
      For a moment he lay back with closed eyes; then the desire that tortured
      him stirred afresh. He lifted his eyelids and looked at his companion.
      &ldquo;Hand it to me,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;Give it to me. Give it to me, Loder.
      Quick as you can! There's a glass on the table and some whiskey and water.
      The tabloids dissolve, you know&mdash;&rdquo; In his new excitement he held out
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder stayed motionless. He had come to fight, to demand, to plead&mdash;if
      need be&mdash;for the one hour for which he had lived; the hour that was
      to satisfy all labor, all endeavor, all ambition. With dogged persistence
      he made one more essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilcote, you wrote last night to recall me&mdash;&rdquo; Once again he paused,
      checked by a new interruption. Sitting up again, Chilcote struck out
      suddenly with his left hand in a rush of his old irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he cried, suddenly, &ldquo;what are you talking about? Look at me!
      Get me the stuff. I tell you it's imperative.&rdquo; In his excitement his
      breath failed and he coughed. At the effort his whole frame was shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder walked to the dressing-table, then back to the bed. A deep agitation
      was at work in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote's lips parted. &ldquo;Loder,&rdquo; he said, faintly&mdash;&ldquo;Loder, I
      must&mdash;I must have it. It's imperative.&rdquo; Once more he attempted to
      lift himself, but the effort was futile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loder&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a fierce gesture the other turned on him. &ldquo;Good heavens! man&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began. Then unaccountably his voice changed. The suggestion that had
      been hovering in his mind took sudden and definite shape. &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he
      said, in a lower voice. &ldquo;All right! Stay as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed to where the empty tumbler stood and hastily mixed the whiskey
      and water; then crossing to the mantel-piece where lay the small glass
      tube containing the tightly packed tabloids, he paused and glanced once
      more towards the bed. &ldquo;How many?&rdquo; he said, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote lifted his head. His face was pitiably drawn, but the feverish
      brightness in his eyes had increased. &ldquo;Five,&rdquo; he said, sharply. &ldquo;Five. Do
      you hear, Loder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five?&rdquo; Involuntarily Loder lowered the hand that held the tube. From
      previous confidences of Chilcote's he knew the amount of morphia contained
      in each tabloid, and realized that five tabloids, if not an absolutely
      dangerous, was at least an excessive dose, even for one accustomed to the
      drug. For a moment his resolution failed; then the dominant-note of his
      nature&mdash;the unconscious, fundamental egotism on which his character
      was based&mdash;asserted itself beyond denial. It might be reprehensible,
      it might even be criminal to accede to such a request, made by a man in
      such a condition of body and mind; yet the laws of the universe demanded
      self-assertion&mdash;prompted every human mind to desire, to grasp, and to
      hold. With a perception swifter than any he had experienced, he realized
      the certain respite to be gained by yielding to his impulse. He looked at
      Chilcote with his haggard, anxious expression, his eager, restless eyes;
      and a vision of himself followed sharp upon his glance. A vision of the
      untiring labor of the past ten days, of the slowly kindling ambition, of
      the supremacy all but gained. Then, as the picture completed itself, he
      lifted his hand with an abrupt movement and dropped the five tabloids one
      after another into the glass.

    <h2>
      XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having taken a definite step in any direction, it was not in Loder's
      nature to wish it retraced. His face was set, but set with determination,
      when he closed the outer door of his own rooms and passed quietly down the
      stairs and out into the silent court. The thought of Chilcote, his
      pitiable condition, his sordid environments, were things that required a
      firm will to drive into the background of the imagination; but a whole
      inferno of such visions would not have daunted Loder on that morning as,
      unobserved by any eyes, he left the little court-yard with its grass, its
      trees, its pavement&mdash;all so distastefully familiar&mdash;and passed
      down the Strand towards life and action.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked, his steps increased in speed and vigor. Now, for the first
      time, he fully appreciated the great mental strain that he had undergone
      in the past ten days&mdash;the unnatural tension; the suppressed, but
      perpetual, sense of impending recall; the consequently high pressure at
      which work, and even existence, had been carried on. And as he hurried
      forward the natural reaction to this state of things came upon him in a
      flood of security and confidence&mdash;a strong realization of the
      temporary respite and freedom for which no price would have seemed too
      high. The moment for which he had unconsciously lived ever since
      Chilcote's first memorable proposition was within reach at last&mdash;safeguarded
      by his own action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walk from Clifford's Inn to Grosvenor Square was long enough to dispel
      any excitement that his interview had aroused; and long before the
      well-known house came into view he felt sufficiently braced mentally and
      physically to seek Eve in the morning-room&mdash;where he instinctively
      felt she would still be waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he encountered and overpassed the obstacle that had so nearly
      threatened ruin; and, with the singleness of purpose that always
      distinguished him, he was able, once having passed it, to dismiss it
      altogether from his mind. From the moment of his return to Chilcote's
      house no misgiving as to his own action, no shadow of doubt, rose to
      trouble his mind. His feelings on the matter were quite simple. He had
      inordinately desired a certain opportunity; one factor had arisen to debar
      that opportunity, and he, claiming the right of strength, had set the
      barrier aside. In the simplicity of the reasoning lay its power to
      convince; and were a tonic needed to brace him for his task, he was
      provided with one in the masterful sense of a difficulty set at nought.
      For the man who has fought and conquered one obstacle feels strong to
      vanquish a score.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this day, at the reassembling of Parliament, that Fraide's great
      blow was to be struck. In the ten days since the affair of the caravans
      had been reported from Persia public feeling had run high, and it was upon
      the pivot of this incident that Loder's attack was to turn; for, as Lakely
      was fond of remarking, &ldquo;In the scales of public opinion, one dead
      Englishman has more weight than the whole Eastern Question!&rdquo; It had been
      arranged that, following the customary procedure, Loder was to rise after
      questions at the morning sitting and ask leave to move the adjournment of
      the House on a definite matter of urgent public importance; upon which&mdash;leave
      having been granted by the rising of forty members in his support&mdash;the
      way was to lie open for his definite attack at the evening sitting. And it
      was with a mind attuned to this plan of action that he retired to the
      study immediately he had breakfasted, and settled to a final revision of
      his speech before an early party conference should compel him to leave the
      house. But here again circumstances were destined to change his programme.
      Scarcely had he sorted his notes and drawn his chair to Chilcote's desk
      than Renwick entered the room with the same air of important haste that he
      had shown on a previous occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from Mr. Fraide, sir. But there's no answer,&rdquo; he said, with
      unusual brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder waited till he had left the room, then he tore the letter open. He
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR CHILCOTE,&mdash;Lakely is the recipient of special and very vital
      news from Meshed&mdash;unofficial, but none the less alarming. Acts of
      Russian aggression towards British traders are reported to be rapidly
      increasing, and it is stated that the authority of the Consulate is
      treated with contempt. Pending a possible confirmation of this, I would
      suggest that you keep an open mind on the subject of to-night's speech. By
      adopting an anticipatory&mdash;even an unprepared&mdash;attitude you may
      find your hand materially strengthened. I shall put my opinions before you
      more explicitly when we meet.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         &ldquo;Yours faithfully,
                                 HERBERT FRAIDE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The letter, worded with Fraide's usual restraint, made a strong impression
      on its recipient. The thought that his speech might not only express
      opinions already tacitly held, but voice a situation of intense and
      national importance, struck him with full force. For many minutes after he
      had grasped the meaning of Fraide's message he sat neglectful of his
      notes, his elbows resting on the desk, his face between his hands, stirred
      by the suggestion that here might lie a greater opportunity than any he
      had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still moved by this new suggestion, he attended the party conclave that
      Fraide had convened, and afterwards lunched with and accompanied his
      leader to the House. They spoke very little as they drove to Westminster,
      for each was engrossed by his own thoughts. Only once did Fraide allude to
      the incident that was paramount in both their minds. Then, turning to
      Loder with a smile of encouragement, he had laid his fingers for an
      instant on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilcote,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;when the time comes, remember you have all my
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking back upon that day, Loder often wondered at the calmness with
      which he bore the uncertainty. To sit apparently unmoved, and wait without
      emotion for news that might change the whole tenor of one's action, would
      have tried the stoicism of the most experienced; to the novice it was
      wellnigh unendurable. And it was under these conditions, and fighting
      against these odds, that he sat through the long afternoon in Chilcote's
      place, obeying the dictates of his chief. But if the day was fraught with
      difficulties for him, it was fraught with dulness and disappointment for
      others; for the undercurrent of interest that had stirred at the Easter
      adjournment, and risen with added force on this first day of the new
      session, was gradually but surely threatened with extinction, as hour
      after hour passed, bringing no suggestion of the battle that had on every
      side been tacitly expected. Slowly and unmistakably speculation and
      dissatisfaction crept into the atmosphere of the House, as moment
      succeeded moment, and the Opposition made no sign. Was Fraide shirking the
      attack? Or was he playing a waiting game? Again and again the question
      arose, filling the air with a passing flicker of interest; but each time
      it sprang up only to die down again, as the ordinary business of the day
      dragged itself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, as the afternoon wore on, daylight began to fade. Loder,
      sitting rigidly in Chilcote's place, watched with suppressed inquiry the
      faces of the men who entered through the constantly swinging doors; but
      not one face, so eagerly scanned, carried the message for which he waited.
      Monotonously and mechanically the time passed. The Government, adopting a
      neutral attitude, carefully skirted all dangerous subjects; while the
      Opposition, acting under Fraide's suggestion, assisted rather than
      hindered the programme of postponement. For the moment the eagerly
      anticipated reassembling threatened dismal failure; and it was with a
      universal movement of weariness and relief that at last the House rose to
      dine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are no possibilities so elastic as those of politics. At
      half-past seven the House rose in a spirit of boredom and disappointment;
      and at eight o'clock the lobbies, the dining-room, the entire space of the
      vast building, was stirred into activity by the arrival of a single
      telegraphic message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new development for which Fraide had waited came indeed, but it came
      with a force he had little anticipated. With a thrill of awe and
      consternation men heard and repeated the astounding news that&mdash;while
      personally exercising his authority on behalf of British traders&mdash;Sir
      William Brice-Field, Consul-General at Meshed, had been fired at by a
      Russian officer and instantly killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval immediately following the receipt of this news was too
      confused for detailed remembrance. Two ideas made themselves slowly felt&mdash;a
      deep horror that such an event could obtrude itself upon our high
      civilization, and a strong personal dismay that so honored, distinguished,
      and esteemed a representative as Sir William Brice-Field could have been
      allowed to meet death in so terrible a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the consciousness of this feeling&mdash;the consciousness that,
      in his own person, he might voice, not only the feelings of his party, but
      those of the whole country&mdash;that Loder rose an hour later to make his
      long-delayed attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood silent for a moment, as he had done on an earlier occasion; but
      this time his motive was different. Roused beyond any feeling of
      self-consciousness, he waited as by right for the full attention of the
      House; then quietly, but with self-possessed firmness, he moved the motion
      for adjournment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a match to a train of powder, the words set flame to the excitement
      that had smouldered for weeks; and in an atmosphere of stirring activity,
      a scene of such tense and vital concentration as the House has rarely
      witnessed, he found inspiration for his great achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give Loder's speech in mere words would be little short of futile. The
      gift of oratory is too illusive, too much a matter of eye and voice and
      individuality, to allow of cold reproduction. To those who heard him speak
      on that night of April 18th the speech will require no recalling; and to
      those who did not hear him there would be no substitute in bare
      reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moment of action it mattered nothing to him that his previous
      preparations were to a great extent rendered useless by this news that had
      come with such paralyzing effect. In the sweeping consciousness of his own
      ability, he found added joy in the freedom it opened up. He ceased to
      consider that by fate he was a Conservative, bound by traditional
      conventionalities: in that great moment he knew himself sufficiently a man
      to exercise whatever individuality instinct prompted. He forgot the
      didactic methods by which he had proposed to show knowledge of his subject&mdash;both
      as a past and a future factor in European politics. With his own strong
      appreciation of present things, he saw and grasped the vast present
      interest lying beneath his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fifty minutes he held the interest of the House, speaking insistently,
      fearlessly, commandingly on the immediate need of action. He
      unhesitatingly pointed out that the news which had just reached England
      was not so much an appalling fact as a sinister warning to those in whose
      keeping lay the safety of the country's interests. Lastly, with a fine
      touch of eloquence, he paid tribute to the steadfast fidelity of such men
      as Sir William Brice-Field, who, whatever political complications arise at
      home, pursue their duty unswervingly on the outposts of the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his last words there was silence&mdash;the silence that marks a genuine
      effect&mdash;then all at once, with vehement, impressive force, the storm
      of enthusiasm broke its bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those stupendous bursts of feeling that no etiquette, no
      decorum is powerful enough to quell. As he resumed his seat, very pale,
      but exalted as men are exalted only once or twice in a lifetime, it rose
      about him&mdash;clamorous, spontaneous, undeniable. Near at hand were the
      faces of his party, excited and triumphant; across the house were the
      faces of Sefborough and his Ministry, uncomfortable and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult swelled, then fell away; and in the partial lull that followed
      Fraide leaned over the back of his seat. His quiet, dignified expression
      was unaltered, but his eyes were intensely bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilcote,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I don't congratulate you&mdash;or myself. I
      congratulate the country on possessing a great man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remaining features of the debate followed quickly one upon the other;
      the electric atmosphere of the House possessed a strong incentive power.
      Immediately Loder's ovation had subsided, the Under-Secretary for Foreign
      Affairs rose and in a careful and non-incriminating reply defended the
      attitude of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came Fraide, who, in one of his rare and polished speeches, touched
      with much feeling upon his personal grief at the news reported from
      Persia, and made emphatic indorsement of Loder's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Fraide came one or two dissentient Liberals, and then Sefborough
      himself closed the debate. His speech was masterly and fluent; but though
      any disquietude he may have felt was well disguised under a tone of
      reassuring ease, the attempt to rehabilitate his position&mdash;already
      weakened in more than one direction&mdash;was a task beyond his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid extraordinary excitement the division followed&mdash;and with it a
      Government defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until half an hour after the votes had, been taken that Loder,
      freed at last from persistent congratulations, found opportunity to look
      for Eve. In accordance with a promise made that morning, he was to find
      her waiting outside the Ladies' Gallery at the close of the debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disengaging himself from the group of men who had surrounded and followed
      him down the lobby, he discarded the lift and ran up the narrow staircase.
      Reaching the landing, he went forward hurriedly; then with a certain
      abrupt movement he paused. In the doorway leading to the gallery Eve was
      waiting for him. The place was not brightly lighted, and she was standing
      in the shadow; but it needed only a glance to assure his recognition. He
      could almost have seen in the dark that night, so vivid were his
      perceptions. He took a step towards her, then again he stopped. In a
      second glance he realized that her eyes were bright with tears; and it was
      with the strangest sensation he had ever experienced that the knowledge
      flashed upon him. Here, also, he had struck the same note&mdash;the
      long-coveted note of supremacy. It had rung out full and clear as he stood
      in Chilcote's place dominating the House; it had besieged him clamorously
      as he passed along the lobbies amid a sea of friendly hands and voices;
      now in the quiet of the deserted gallery it came home to him with deeper
      meaning from the eyes of Chilcote's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a thought he put out his hands and caught hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't get away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm very late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a smile that scattered her tears Eve looked up. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; she said,
      laughing a little. &ldquo;I don't know what the time is. I scarcely know whether
      it's night or day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still holding one of her hands, he drew her down the stairs; but as they
      reached the last step she released her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the carriage!&rdquo; she said, with another little laugh of nervous
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the stairs they were surrounded. Men whose faces Loder
      barely knew crowded about him. The intoxication of excitement was still in
      the air&mdash;the instinct that a new force had made itself felt, a new
      epoch been entered upon, stirred prophetically in every mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the enthusiastic concourse of men, they came unexpectedly
      upon Fraide and Lady Sarah surrounded by a group of friends. The old
      statesman came forward instantly, and, taking Loder's arm, walked with him
      to Chilcote's waiting brougham. He said little as they slowly made their
      way to the carriage, but the pressure of his fingers was tense and an
      unwonted color showed in his face. When Eve and Loder had taken their
      seats he stepped to the edge of the curb. They were alone for the moment,
      and, leaning close to the carriage, he put his hand through the open
      window. In silence he took Eve's fingers and held them in a long,
      affectionate pressure; then he released them and took Loder's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Chilcote,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have proved yourself worthy of her.
      Good-night.&rdquo; He turned quickly and rejoined his waiting friends. In
      another second the horses had wheeled round, and Eve and Loder were
      carried swiftly forward into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great moments of man's life woman comes before&mdash;and after.
      Some shadow of this truth was in, Eve's mind as she lay back in her seat
      with closed eyes, and parted lips. It seemed that life came to her now for
      the first time&mdash;came in the glad, proud, satisfying tide of things
      accomplished. This was her hour: and the recognition of it brought the
      blood to her face in a sudden, happy rush. There had been no need to
      precipitate its coming; it had been ordained from the first. Whether she
      desired it or no, whether she strove to draw it nearer or strove to ward
      it off, its coming had been inevitable. She opened her eyes suddenly and
      looked out into the darkness&mdash;the darkness throbbing with multitudes
      of lives, all awaiting, all desiring fulfilment. She was no longer lonely,
      no longer aloof; she was kin with all this pitiful, admirable, sinning,
      loving humanity. Again tears of pride and happiness filled her eyes. Then
      suddenly the thing she had waited for came to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder leaned close to her. She was conscious of his nearer presence, of
      his strong, masterful personality. With a thrill that caught her breath,
      she felt his arm. about her shoulder and heard the sound of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;I love you. Do you understand I love you.&rdquo; And
      drawing her close to him he bent and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Loder, to do was to do fully. When he gave, he gave generously; when
      he swept aside a barrier he left no stone standing. He had been slow to
      recognize his capacities&mdash;slower still to recognize his feelings. But
      now that the knowledge came he received it openly. In this matter of newly
      comprehended love he gave no thought to either past or future. That they
      loved and were alone was all he knew or questioned. She was as much Eve&mdash;the
      one woman&mdash;as though they were together in the primeval garden; and
      in that spirit he claimed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He neither spoke nor behaved extravagantly in that great moment of
      comprehension. He acted quietly, with the completeness of purpose that he
      gave to everything. He had found a new capacity within himself, and he was
      strong enough to dread no weakness in displaying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding her close to him, he repeated his declaration again and again, as
      though repetition ratified it. He found no need to question her feeling
      for him&mdash;he had divined it in a flash of inspiration as she stood
      waiting in the doorway of the gallery; but his own surrender was a
      different matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the carriage passed round the corner of Whitehall and dipped into the
      traffic of Piccadilly he bent down again until her soft hair brushed his
      face; and the warm personal contact, the slight, fresh smell of violets so
      suggestive of her presence, stirred' him afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, vehemently, &ldquo;do you understand? Do you know that I have
      loved you always&mdash;from the very first?&rdquo; As he said it he bent still
      nearer, kissing her lips, her forehead, her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the horses slackened speed and then stopped, arrested
      by one of the temporary blocks that so often occur in the traffic of
      Piccadilly Circus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, preoccupied with his own feelings, scarcely noticed the halt, but
      Eve drew away from him laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't!&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage had stopped beside one of the small islands that intersect
      the place; a group of pedestrians were crowded upon it, under the light of
      the electric lamp&mdash;wayfarers who, like themselves, were awaiting a
      passage. Loder took a cursory glance at them, then turned back to Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they, after all, but men and women?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They'd understand&mdash;every
      one of them.&rdquo; He laughed in his turn; nevertheless he withdrew his arm.
      Her feminine thought for conventionalities appealed to him. It was an
      acknowledgment of dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while they sat silent, the light of the street lamp flickering
      through the glass of the window, the hum of voices and traffic coming to
      them in a continuous rise and fall of sound. At first the position was
      interesting; but, as the seconds followed each other, it gradually became
      irksome. Loder, watching the varying expressions of Eve's face, grew
      impatient of the delay, grew suddenly eager to be alone again in the
      fragrant darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impelled by the desire, he leaned forward and opened the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's find the meaning of this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is there nobody to regulate
      the traffic?&rdquo; As he spoke he half rose and leaned out of the window. There
      was a touch of imperious annoyance in his manner. Fresh from the
      realization of power, there was something irksome in this commonplace
      check to his desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it possible to get out of this?&rdquo; Eve heard him call to the
      coachman. Then she heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had leaned out of the carriage with the intention of looking onward
      towards the cause of the delay; instead, by that magnetic attraction that
      undoubtedly exists, he looked directly in front of him at the group of
      people waiting on the little island&mdash;at one man who leaned against
      the lamp-post in an attitude of apathy&mdash;a man with a pallid, unshaven
      face and lustreless eyes, who wore a cap drawn low over his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at this man, and the man saw and returned his glance. For a
      space that seemed interminable they held each other's eyes; then very
      slowly Loder drew back into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he dropped into his seat, Eve glanced at him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has anything happened? You look ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her and tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing to worry about.&rdquo; He spoke quickly, but
      his voice had suddenly become flat. All the command, all the domination
      had dropped away from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve bent close to him, her face lighting up with anxious tenderness. &ldquo;It
      was the excitement,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the strain of tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her; but he made no attempt to press the fingers that clasped
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;Yes. It was the excitement of to-night&mdash;and
      the reaction.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning at eight o'clock, and again without breakfast, Loder
      covered the distance between Grosvenor Square and Clifford's Inn. He left
      Chilcote's house hastily&mdash;with a haste that only an urgent motive
      could have driven him to adopt. His steps were quick and uneven as he
      traversed the intervening streets; his shoulders lacked their decisive
      pose, and his pale face was marked with shadows beneath the eyes&mdash;shadows
      that bore witness to the sleepless night spent in pacing Chilcote's vast
      and lonely room. By the curious effect of circumstances the likeness
      between the two men had never been more significantly marked than on that
      morning of April 19th, when Loder walked along the pavements crowded with
      early workers and brisk with insistent news-venders already alive to the
      value of last night's political crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irony of this last element in the day's concerns came to him fully
      when one newsboy, more energetic than his fellows, thrust a paper in front
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensation in the 'Ouse, sir! Speech by Mr. Chilcote! Government defeat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Loder stopped and his face reddened. The tide of emotions
      still ran strong. His hand went instinctively to his pocket; then his lips
      set. He shook his head and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the same hard expression about his mouth, he turned into Clifford's
      Inn, passed through his own doorway, and mounted the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time there was no milk-can on the threshold of his rooms and the door
      yielded to his pressure without the need of a key. With a strange
      sensation of reluctance he walked into the narrow passage and paused,
      uncertain which room to enter first. As he stood hesitating a voice from
      the sitting-room settled the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; it called, irritably. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further ceremony the intruder pushed the door open and entered the
      room. As he did so he drew a quick breath&mdash;whether of disappointment
      or relief it was impossible to say. Whether he had hoped for or dreaded
      it, Chilcote was conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Loder entered he was sitting by the cheerless grate, the ashes of
      yesterday's fire showing charred and dreary where the sun touched them.
      His back was to the light, and about his shoulders was an old plaid rug.
      Behind him on the table stood a cup, a teapot, and the can of milk;
      farther off a kettle was set to boil upon a tiny spirit-stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all strong situations we are more or less commonplace. Loder's first
      remark as he glanced round the disordered room seemed strangely
      inefficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Robins?&rdquo; he asked, in a brusque voice. His mind teemed with big
      considerations, yet this was his first involuntary question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote had started at the entrance of his visitor; now he sat staring at
      him, his hands holding the arms of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Robins?&rdquo; Loder asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. She&mdash;I&mdash;We didn't hit it off. She's gone&mdash;went
      yesterday.&rdquo; He shivered and drew the rug about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilcote&mdash;&rdquo; Loder began, sternly; then he paused. There was
      something in the other's look and attitude that arrested him. A change of
      expression passed over his own face; he turned about with an abrupt
      gesture, pulled off his coat and threw it on a chair; then crossing
      deliberately to the fireplace, he began to rake the ashes from the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a few minutes he had a fire crackling where the bed of dead cinders
      had been, and, having finished the task, he rose slowly from his knees,
      wiped his hands, and crossed to the table. On the small spirit-stove the
      kettle had boiled and the cover was lifting and falling with a tinkling
      sound. Blowing out the flame, Loder picked up the teapot, and with hands
      that were evidently accustomed to the task set about making the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole operation he never spoke, though all the while he was
      fully conscious of Chilcote's puzzled gaze. The tea ready, he poured it
      into the cup and carried it across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink this!&rdquo; he said, laconically. &ldquo;The fire will be up presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote extended a cold and shaky hand. &ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder checked him almost savagely. &ldquo;I do&mdash;as well as though I had
      followed you from Piccadilly last night! You've been hanging about, God
      knows where, till the small hours of the morning; then you've come back&mdash;slunk
      back, starving for your damned poison and shivering with cold. You've
      settled the first part of the business, but the cold has still to be
      reckoned with. Drink the tea. I've something to say to you.&rdquo; He mastered
      his vehemence, and, walking to the window, stood looking down into the
      court. His eyes were blank, his face hard; his ears heard nothing but the
      faint sound of Chilcote's swallowing, the click of the cup against his
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time that seemed interminable he stood motionless; then, when he
      judged the tea finished, he turned slowly. Chilcote had drawn closer to
      the fire. He was obviously braced by the warmth; and the apathy that hung
      about him was to some extent dispelled. Still moving slowly, Loder went
      towards him, and, relieving him of the empty cup, stood looking down at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilcote,&rdquo; he said, very quietly, &ldquo;I've come to fell you that the thing
      must end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After he spoke there was a prolonged pause; then, as if shaken with sudden
      consciousness, Chilcote rose. The rug dropped from one shoulder and hung
      down ludicrously; his hand caught the back of the chair for support; his
      unshaven face looked absurd and repulsive in its sudden expression of
      scared inquiry. Loder involuntarily turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;It's over; we've come to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Chilcote articulated, blankly. &ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo; In his confusion he
      could think of no better word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I throw it up. My side of the bargain's off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote's lips parted stammeringly. The apathy caused by physical
      exhaustion and his recently administered drug was passing from him; the
      hopelessly shattered condition of mind and body was showing through it
      like a skeleton through a thin covering of flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Loder avoided the frightened surprise of his, eyes. &ldquo;Because I
      withdraw,&rdquo; he answered, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly Chilcote's tongue was loosened. &ldquo;Loder,&rdquo; he cried,
      excitedly, &ldquo;you can't do it! God! man, you can't do it!&rdquo; To reassure
      himself he laughed&mdash;a painfully thin echo of his old, sarcastic
      laugh. &ldquo;If it's a matter of greater opportunity&mdash;&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;of more
      money&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Loder turned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; he said, so menacingly that the other stopped. Then by an
      effort he conquered himself, &ldquo;It's not a matter of money, Chilcote,&rdquo; he
      said, quietly; &ldquo;it's a matter of necessity.&rdquo; He brought the word out with
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote glanced up. &ldquo;Necessity?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;How? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reiteration roused Loder. &ldquo;Because there was a great scene in the
      House last night,&rdquo; he began, hurriedly; &ldquo;because when you go back you'll
      find that Sefborough has smashed up over the assassination of Sir William
      Brice-Field at Meshed, and that you have made your mark in a big speech;
      and because&mdash;&rdquo; Abruptly he stopped. The thing he had come to say&mdash;the
      thing he had meant to say&mdash;would not be said. Either his tongue or
      his resolution failed him, and for the instant he stood as silent and
      almost as ill at ease as his companion. Then all at once inspiration came
      to him, in the suggestion of a wellnigh forgotten argument by which he
      might influence Chilcote and save his own self-respect. &ldquo;It's all over,
      Chilcote,&rdquo; he said, more quietly; &ldquo;it has run itself out.&rdquo; And in a dozen
      sentences he sketched the story of Lillian Astrupp&mdash;her past
      relations with himself, her present suspicions. It was not what he had
      meant to say; it was not what he had come to say; but it served the
      purpose&mdash;it saved him humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote listened to the last word; then, as the other finished, he
      dropped nervously back into his chair. &ldquo;Good heavens! man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why
      didn't you tell me&mdash;why didn't you warn me, instead of filling my
      mind with your political position? Your political position!&rdquo; He laughed
      unsteadily. The long spells of indulgence that had weakened his already
      maimed faculties showed in the laugh, in the sudden breaking of his voice.
      &ldquo;You must do something, Loder!&rdquo; he added, nervously, checking his
      amusement; &ldquo;you must do something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked down at him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, decisively. &ldquo;It's your turn now.
      It's you who've got to do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote's face turned a shade grayer. &ldquo;I can't,&rdquo; he said, below his
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't? Oh yes, you can. We can all do&mdash;anything. It's not too late;
      there's just sufficient time. Chilcote,&rdquo; he added, suddenly, &ldquo;don't you
      see that the thing has been madness all along&mdash;has been like playing
      with the most infernal explosives? You may thank whatever you have faith
      in that nobody has been smashed up! You are going back. Do you understand
      me? You are going back&mdash;now, to-day, before it's too late.&rdquo; There was
      a great change in Loder; his strong, imperturbable face was stirred; he
      was moved in both voice and manner. Time after time he repeated his
      injunction&mdash;reasoning, expostulating, insisting. It almost seemed
      that he fought some strenuous invisible force rather than the shattered
      man before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote moved nervously in his seat. It was the first real clash of
      personalities. He felt it&mdash;recognized it by instinct. The sense of
      domination had fallen on him; he knew himself impotent in the other's
      hands. Whatever he might attempt in moments of solitude, he possessed no
      voice in presence of this invincible second self. For a while he struggled&mdash;he
      did not fight, he struggled to resist&mdash;then, lifting his eyes, he met
      Loder's. &ldquo;And what will you do?&rdquo; he said, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder returned his questioning gaze; but almost immediately he turned
      aside. &ldquo;I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, I shall leave London.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      But Loder did not leave London. And the hour of two on the day following
      his dismissal of Chilcote found him again in his sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at the centre-table surrounded by a cloud of smoke; a pipe was
      between his lips and the morning's newspapers lay in a heap beside his
      elbow. To the student of humanity his attitude was intensely interesting.
      It was the attitude of a man trammelled by the knowledge of his strength.
      Before him, as he sat smoking, stretched a future of absolute nothingness;
      and towards this blank future one portion of his consciousness&mdash;a
      struggling and as yet scarcely sentient portion&mdash;pushed him
      inevitably; while another&mdash;a vigorous, persistent, human portion&mdash;cried
      to him to pause. So actual, so clamorous was this silent mental combat
      that had raged unceasingly since the moment of his renunciation that at
      last in physical response to it he pushed back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too late!&rdquo; he said, aloud. &ldquo;I'm a fool. It's too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then abruptly, astonishingly, as though in direct response to his spoken
      thought, the door opened and Chilcote walked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Loder rose and stared at him. The feeling he acknowledged to
      himself was anger; but below the anger a very different sensation ran
      riotously strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was in time to this second feeling, this sudden, lawless joy, that
      his pulses beat as he turned a cold face on the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chilcote was impervious to sternness. He was mentally shaken and
      distressed, though outwardly irreproachable, even to the violets in the
      lapel of his coat&mdash;the violets that for a week past had been brought
      each morning to the door of Loder's rooms by Eve's maid. For one second,
      as Loder's eyes' rested on the flowers, a sting of ungovernable jealousy
      shot through him; then as suddenly it died away, superseded by another
      feeling&mdash;a feeling of new, spontaneous joy. Worn by Chilcote or by
      himself, the flowers were a symbol!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said again, in a gentler voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote had walked to the table and laid down his hat. His face was white
      and the muscles of his lips twitched nervously as he drew off his gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven, you're here!&rdquo; he said, shortly. &ldquo;Give me something to
      drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In silence Loder brought out the whiskey and set it on the table; then
      instinctively he turned aside. As plainly as though he saw the action, he
      mentally figured Chilcote's furtive glance, the furtive movement of his
      fingers to his waistcoat-pocket, the hasty dropping of the tabloids into
      the glass. For an instant the sense of his tacit connivance came to him
      sharply; the next, he flung it from him. The human, inner voice was
      whispering its old watchword. The strong man has no time to waste over his
      weaker brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      When he heard Chilcote lay down his tumbler he looked back again. &ldquo;Well,
      what is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo; He strove resolutely to
      keep his voice severe, but, try as he might, he could not quite subdue the
      eager force that lay behind his words. Once again, as on the night of
      their second interchange, life had become a phoenix, rising to fresh
      existence even while he sifted its ashes. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote had set down his glass. He was nervously passing his handkerchief
      across his lips. There was something in the gesture that attracted Loder.
      Looking at him more attentively, he saw what his own feelings and the
      other's conventional dress had blinded him to&mdash;the almost piteous
      panic and excitement in his visitor's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something's gone wrong!&rdquo; he said, with abrupt intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote started. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;that is, yes,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder moved round the table. &ldquo;Something's gone wrong,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And
      you've come to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone unnerved Chilcote; he suddenly dropped into a chair. &ldquo;It&mdash;it
      wasn't my fault,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I&mdash;I have had a horrible time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder's lips tightened. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yes&mdash;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other glanced up with a gleam of his old suspicion &ldquo;'Twas all my
      nerves, Loder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Yes, of course.&rdquo; Loder's interruption was curt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote eyed him doubtfully. Then recollection took the place of doubt,
      and a change passed over his expression. &ldquo;It wasn't my fault,&rdquo; he began,
      hastily. &ldquo;On my soul, it wasn't! It was Crapham's beastly fault for
      showing her into the morning-room&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder kept silent. His curiosity had flared into sudden life at the
      other's words, but he feared to break the shattered train of thought even
      by a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence Chilcote moved uneasily. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, at last,
      &ldquo;when I was here with you I&mdash;I felt strong. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. When you were here with me you felt strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's it. While I was here, I felt I could do the thing. But when I
      went home&mdash;when I went up to my rooms&mdash;&rdquo; Again he paused,
      passing his handkerchief across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you went up to your rooms?&rdquo; Loder strove hard to keep his control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my room&mdash;? Oh, I&mdash;I forget about that. I forget about the
      night&rdquo; He hesitated confusedly. &ldquo;All I remember is the coming down to
      breakfast next morning&mdash;this morning&mdash;at twelve o'clock&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned to the table and poured himself out some whiskey. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      acquiesced, in a very quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word Chilcote rose from his seat. His disquietude was very evident.
      &ldquo;Oh, there was breakfast on the table when I came down-stairs&mdash;breakfast
      with flowers and a horrible, dazzling glare of sun. It was then, Loder, as
      I stood and looked into the room, that the impossibility of it all came to
      me&mdash;that I knew I couldn't stand it&mdash;couldn't go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder swallowed his whiskey slowly. His sense of overpowering curiosity
      held him very still; but he made no effort to prompt his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Chilcote shifted his position agitatedly. &ldquo;It, had to be done,&rdquo; he
      said, disjointedly. &ldquo;I had to do it&mdash;then and there. The things were
      on the bureau&mdash;the pens and ink and telegraph forms. They tempted
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laid down his glass suddenly. An exclamation rose to his lips, but
      he checked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the slight sound of the tumbler touching the table Chilcote turned; but
      there was no expression on the other's face to affright him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tempted me,&rdquo; he repeated, hastily. &ldquo;They seemed like magnets&mdash;they
      seemed to draw me towards them. I sat at the bureau staring at them for a
      long time; then a terrible compulsion seized me&mdash;something you could
      never understand&mdash;and I caught up the nearest pen and wrote just what
      was in my mind. It wasn't a telegram, properly speaking&mdash;it was more
      a letter. I wanted you back and I had to make myself plain. The writing of
      the message seemed to steady me; the mere forming of the words quieted my
      mind. I was almost cool when I got up from the bureau and pressed the bell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I rang for a servant. I had to send the wire myself, so I had to get
      a cab.&rdquo; His voice rose to irritability. &ldquo;I pressed the bell several times;
      but the thing had gone wrong&mdash;'twouldn't work. At last I gave it up
      and went into the corridor to call some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; In the intense suspense of the moment the word escaped Loder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I went out of the room; but there at the door, before I could call
      anybody, I knocked up against that idiot Greening. He was looking for me&mdash;for
      you, rather&mdash;about some beastly Wark affair. I tried to explain that
      I wasn't in a state for business; I tried to shake him off, but he was
      worse than Blessington. At last, to be rid of the fellow, I went with him
      to the study&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the telegram?&rdquo; Loder began; then again he checked himself. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I
      understand,&rdquo; he added, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm getting to the telegram! I wish you wouldn't jar me with sudden
      questions. I wasn't in the study more than a minute&mdash;more than five
      or six minutes&mdash;&rdquo; His voice became confused; the strain of the
      connected recital was telling upon him. With nervous haste he made a rush
      for the end of his story. &ldquo;I wasn't more than seven or eight minutes in
      the study; then, as I came down-stairs, Crapham met me in the hall. He
      told me that Lillian Astrupp had called and wished to see me. And that he
      had shown her into the morning-room&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The morning-room?&rdquo; Loder suddenly stepped back from the table. &ldquo;The
      morning-room? With your telegram lying on the bureau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sudden speech and movement startled Chilcote. The blood rushed to his
      face, then died out, leaving it ashen. &ldquo;Don't do that, Loder!&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I can't bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an immense effort Loder controlled himself. &ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go
      on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going on! I tell you I'm going on. I got a horrid shock when Chapham
      told me. Your story came clattering through my mind. I knew Lillian had
      come to see you&mdash;I knew there was going to be a scene&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the telegram? The telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote paid no heed to the interruption. He was following his own train
      of ideas. &ldquo;I knew she had come to see you&mdash;I knew there was going to
      be a scene. When I got to the morning-room my hand was shaking so that I
      could scarcely turn the handle; then, as the door opened, I could have
      cried out with relief. Eve was there as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I don't think I was ever so glad to see her in my life.&rdquo; He laughed
      almost hysterically. &ldquo;I was quite civil to her, and she was&mdash;quite
      sweet to me&mdash;&rdquo; Again he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder's lips tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it saved the situation. Even if Lillian wanted to be nasty, she
      couldn't, while Eve was there. We talked for about ten minutes. We were
      quite an amiable trio. Then Lillian told me why she'd called. She wanted
      me to make a fourth in a theatre party at the 'Arcadian' to-night, and I&mdash;I
      was so pleased and so relieved that I said yes!&rdquo; He paused and laughed
      again unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his tense anxiety, Loder ground his heel into the floor. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he
      said, fiercely. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; Chilcote exclaimed. &ldquo;I'm going on&mdash;I'm going on.&rdquo; He passed
      his handkerchief across his lips. &ldquo;We talked for ten minutes or so, and
      then Lillian left. I went with her to the hall door, but Chapham was there
      too&mdash;so I was still safe. She laughed and chatted and seemed in high
      spirits as we crossed the hall, and she was still smiling as she waved to
      me from her motor. But then, Loder&mdash;then, as I stood in the hall, it
      all came to me suddenly. I remembered that Lillian must have been alone in
      the morning-room before Eve found her! I remembered the telegram! I ran
      back to the room, meaning to question Eve as to how long Lillian had been
      alone, but she had left the room. I ran to the bureau&mdash;but the
      telegram wasn't there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, gone. That's why I've come straight here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they confronted each other. Then, moved by a sudden impulse,
      Loder pushed Chilcote aside and crossed the room. An instant later the
      opening and shutting of doors, the hasty pulling out of drawers and moving
      of boxes, came from the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilcote, shaken and nervous, stood for a minute where his companion had
      left him; at last, impelled by curiosity, he too crossed the narrow
      passage and entered the second room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full light streamed in through the open window; the keen spring air
      blew freshly across the house-tops; and on the window-sill a band of
      grimy, joyous sparrows twittered and preened themselves. In the middle of
      the room stood Loder. His coat was off, and round him on chairs and floor
      lay an array of waistcoats, gloves, and ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space Chilcote stood in the doorway staring at him; then his lips
      parted and he took a step forward. &ldquo;Loder&mdash;&rdquo; he said, anxiously.
      &ldquo;Loder, what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned. His shoulders were stiff, his face alight with energy. &ldquo;I'm
      going back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to unravel the tangle you have made.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Loder's plan of action was arrived at before he reached Trafalgar Square.
      The facts of the case were simple. Chilcote had left an incriminating
      telegram on the bureau in the morning-room at Grosvenor Square; by an
      unlucky chance Lillian Astrupp had been shown up into that room, where she
      had remained alone until the moment that Eve, either by request or by
      accident, had found her there. The facts resolved themselves into one
      question. What use had Lillian made of those solitary moments? Without
      deviation, Loder's mind turned towards one answer. Lillian was not the
      woman to lose an opportunity, whether the space at her command were long
      or short. True, Eve too had been alone in the room, while Chilcote had
      accompanied Lillian to the door; but of this he made small account. Eve
      had been there, but Lillian had been there first. Judging by precedent, by
      personal character, by all human probability, it was not to be supposed
      that anything would have been left for the second comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So convinced was he that, reaching Trafalgar Square, he stopped and hailed
      a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cadogan Gardens!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;No. 33.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moments seemed very few before the cab drew up beside the curb and he
      caught his second glimpse of the enamelled door with its silver fittings.
      The white and silver gleamed in the sunshine; banks of cream colored
      hyacinths clustered on the window-sills, filling the clear air with a warm
      and fragrant scent. With that strange sensation of having lived through
      the scene before, Loder left the cab and walked up the steps. Instantly he
      pressed the bell the door was opened by Lillian's discreet, deferential
      man-servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Lady Astrupp at home?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked thoughtful. &ldquo;Her ladyship lunched at home, sir&mdash;&rdquo; he
      began, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder interrupted him. &ldquo;Ask her to see me,&rdquo; he said, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant expressed no surprise. His only comment was to throw the door
      wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll wait in the white room, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll inform her
      ladyship.&rdquo; Chilcote was evidently a frequent and a favored visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner Loder for the second time entered the house so unfamiliar&mdash;and
      yet so familiar in all that it suggested. Entering the drawing-room, he
      had leisure to look about him. It was a beautiful room, large and lofty;
      luxury was evident on every hand, but it was not the luxury that palls or
      offends. Each object was graceful, and possessed its own intrinsic value.
      The atmosphere was too effeminate to appeal to him, but he acknowledged
      the taste and artistic delicacy it conveyed. Almost at the moment of
      acknowledgment the door opened to admit Lillian.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore the same gown of pale-colored cloth, warmed and softened by rich
      furs, that she had worn on the day she and Chilcote had driven in the
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was drawing on her gloves as she came into the room; and pausing near
      the door, she looked across at Loder and, laughed in her slow, amused way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be you,&rdquo; she said, enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder came forward. &ldquo;You expected me?&rdquo; he said, guardedly. A sudden
      conviction filled him that it was not the evidence of her eyes, but
      something at once subtler and more definite, that prompted her recognition
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;Why should I expect you? On the contrary, I'm waiting to know
      why you're here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for an instant; then he answered in her own light tone. &ldquo;As
      far as that goes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let's make it my duty call-having dined with
      you. I'm an old-fashioned person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a full second she surveyed him amusedly; then at last she spoke. &ldquo;My
      dear Jack&rdquo;&mdash;she laid particular stress on the name&mdash;&ldquo;I never
      imagined you punctilious. I should have thought bohemian would have been
      more the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder felt disconcerted and annoyed. Either, like himself, she was fishing
      for information, or she was deliberately playing with him. In his
      perplexity he glanced across the room towards the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian saw the look. &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo; she said, indicating the
      couch. &ldquo;I promise not to make you smoke. I sha'n't even ask you to take
      off your gloves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder made no movement. His mind was unpleasantly upset. It was nearly a
      fortnight since he had seen Lillian, and in the interval her attitude had
      changed, and the change puzzled him. It might mean the philosophy of a
      woman who, knowing herself without adequate weapons, withdraws from a
      combat that has proved fruitless; or it might imply the merely catlike
      desire to toy with a certainty. He looked quickly at the delicate face,
      the green eyes somewhat obliquely set, the unreliable mouth; and instantly
      he inclined to the latter theory. The conviction that she possessed the
      telegram filled him suddenly, and with it came the desire to put his
      belief to the test&mdash;to know beyond question whether her smiling
      unconcern meant malice or mere entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you first came into the room,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;you said 'I
      thought it would be you.' Why did you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she smiled&mdash;the smile that might be malicious or might be
      merely amused. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered at last, &ldquo;I only meant that though I had
      been told Jack Chilcote wanted me, it wasn't Jack Chilcote I expected to
      see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After her statement there was a pause. Loder's position was difficult.
      Instinctively convinced that, strong in the possession of her proof, she
      was enjoying his tantalized discomfort, he yet craved the actual evidence
      that should set his suspicions to rest. Acting upon the desire, he made a
      new beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I came?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian looked up innocently. &ldquo;It's so hard to be certain of anything in
      this world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But one is always at liberty to guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he was perplexed. Her attitude was not quite the attitude of one who
      controls the game, and yet&mdash;He looked at her with a puzzled scrutiny.
      Women for him had always spelled the incomprehensible; he was at his best,
      his strongest, his surest in the presence of men. Feeling his
      disadvantage, yet determined to gain his end, he made a last attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you amuse yourself at Grosvenor Square this morning before Eve
      came to you?&rdquo; he asked. The effort was awkwardly blunt, but it was direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian was buttoning her glove. She did not raise her head as he spoke,
      but her fingers paused in their task. For a second she remained
      motionless, then she looked up slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, sweetly, &ldquo;so I was right in my guess? You did come to find
      out whether I sat in the morning-room with my hands in my lap&mdash;or
      wandered about in search of entertainment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder colored with annoyance and apprehension. Every look, every tone of
      Lillian's was distasteful to him. No microscope could have revealed her
      more fully to him than did his own eyesight. But it was not the moment for
      personal antipathies; there were other interests than his own at stake.
      With new resolution he returned her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must still ask my first question, why did you say, 'I thought it
      would be you?'&rdquo; His gaze was direct&mdash;so direct that it disconcerted
      her. She laughed a little uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; she began; then again she laughed. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she added,
      quickly, as if moved by a fresh impulse, &ldquo;Jack Chilcote made it very
      obvious to any one who was in his morning-room at twelve o'clock today
      that it would be you and not he who would be found filling his place this
      afternoon! It's all very well to talk about honor, but when one walks into
      an empty room and sees a telegram as long as a letter open on a bureau&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her sentence was never finished. Loder had heard what he came to hear;
      any confession she might have to offer was of no moment in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he broke in, brusquely, &ldquo;don't trouble! I should make a
      most unsatisfactory father confessor.&rdquo; He spoke quickly. His color was
      still high, but not of annoyance. His suspense was transformed into
      unpleasant certainty; but the exchange left him surer of himself. His
      perplexity had dropped to a quiet sense of self-reliance; his paramount
      desire was for solitude in which to prepare for the task that lay before
      him; the most congenial task the world possessed&mdash;the unravelling of
      Chilcote's tangled skeins. Looking into Lillian's eyes, he smiled.
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand. &ldquo;I think we've finished&mdash;for
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly extended her fingers. Her expression and attitude were slightly
      puzzled&mdash;a puzzlement that was either spontaneous or singularly well
      assumed. As their hands touched she smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you drop in at the 'Arcadian' to-night?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's the
      dramatized version of 'Other Men's Shoes!' The temptation to make you see
      it was too irresistible&mdash;as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause while she waited for his answer&mdash;her head inclined
      to one side, her green eyes gleaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, conscious of her regard, hesitated for a moment. Then his face
      cleared. &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;'The Arcadian' tonight!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Loder's frame of mind as he left Cadogan Gardens was peculiar. Once more
      he was living in the present&mdash;the forceful, exhilarating present, and
      the knowledge braced him. Upon one point his mind was satisfied. Lillian
      Astrupp had found the telegram, and it remained to him to render her find
      valueless. How he proposed to do this, how he proposed to come out
      triumphant in face of such a situation, was a matter that as yet was
      shapeless in his mind; nevertheless, the danger&mdash;the sense of
      impending conflict&mdash;had a savor of life after the inaction of the day
      and night just passed. Chilcote in his weakness and his entanglement had
      turned to him; and he in his strength and capacity had responded to the
      appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      His step was firm and his bearing assured as he turned into Grosvenor
      Square and walked towards the familiar house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habit of self-deceit is as insidious and tenacious as any vice. For
      one moment on the night of his great speech, as he leaned out of
      Chilcote's carriage and met Chilcote's eyes, Loder had seen himself&mdash;and
      under the shock of revelation had taken decisive action. But in the hours
      subsequent to that action the plausible, inner voice had whispered
      unceasingly, soothing his wounded self-esteem, rebuilding stone by stone
      the temple of his egotism; until at last when Chilcote, panic-stricken at
      his own action, had burst into his rooms ready to plead or to coerce, he
      had found no need for either coercion or entreaty. By a power more subtle
      and effective than any at his command, Loder had been prepared for his
      coming&mdash;unconsciously ready with an acquiescence before his appeal
      had been made. It was the fruit of this preparation, the inevitable
      outcome of it, that strengthened his step and steadied his hand as he
      mounted the steps and opened the hall door of Chilcote's house on that
      eventful afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dignity, the air of quiet solidity, impressed him as it never failed
      to do, as he crossed the large hall and ascended the stairs&mdash;the same
      stairs that he had passed down almost as an outcast not so many hours
      before. He was filled with the sense of things regained; belief in his own
      star lifted him as it had done a hundred times before in these same
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quickened his steps as the sensation came to him. Then, reaching the
      head of the stairs, he turned directly towards Eve's sitting-room, and,
      gaining the door, knocked. The strength of his eagerness, the quick
      beating of his pulse as he waited for a response, surprised him. He had
      told himself many times that his passion, however strong, would never
      again conquer as it had done two nights ago&mdash;and the fact that he had
      come thus candidly to Eve's room was to his mind a proof that temptation
      could be dared. Nevertheless there was something disconcerting to a strong
      man in this merely physical perturbation; and when Eve's voice came to
      him, giving permission to enter, he paused for an instant to steady
      himself; then with sudden decision he opened the door and walked into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blinds were partly drawn, there was a scent of violets in the air, and
      a fire glowed warmly in the grate. He noted these things carefully,
      telling himself that a man should always be alertly sensible of his
      surroundings; then all at once the nice balancing of detail suddenly gave
      way. He forgot everything but the one circumstance that Eve was standing
      in the window&mdash;her back to the light, her face towards him. With his
      pulses beating faster and an unsteady sensation in his brain, he moved
      forward holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve&mdash;?&rdquo; he said below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eve remained motionless. As he came into the room she had glanced at
      him&mdash;a glance of quick, searching question; then with equal
      suddenness she had averted her eyes. As he drew close to her now, she
      remained immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve&mdash;&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I wanted to see you&mdash;I wanted to explain
      about yesterday and about this morning.&rdquo; He paused, suddenly disturbed.
      The full remembrance of the scene in the brougham had surged up at sight
      of her&mdash;had risen a fierce, unquenchable recollection. &ldquo;Eve&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began again in a new, abrupt tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it was that Eve showed herself in a fresh light. From his
      entrance into the room she had stayed motionless, save for her first
      glance of acute inquiry; but now her demeanor changed. For almost the
      first time in Loder's knowledge of her the vitality and force that he had
      vaguely apprehended below her quiet, serene exterior sprang up like a
      flame within whose radius things are illuminated. With a quick gesture she
      turned towards him, her warm color deepening, her eyes suddenly alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I understand. Don't try to explain! Can't you
      see that it's enough to&mdash;to see you as you are&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder was surprised. Remembering their last passionate scene, and the
      damper Chilcote's subsequent presence must inevitably have cast upon it,
      he had expected to be doubtfully received; but the reality of the
      reception left him bewildered. Eve's manner was not that of the ill-used
      wife; its vehemence, its note of desire and depreciation, were more
      suggestive of his own ardent seizing of the present, as distinguished from
      past or future. With an odd sense of confusion he turned to her afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am forgiven?&rdquo; he said. And unconsciously, as he moved nearer, he
      touched her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his touch she started. All the yielding sweetness, all the submission,
      that had marked her two nights ago was gone; in its place she was
      possessed by a curious excitement that stirred while it perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, moved by the sensation, took another step forward. &ldquo;Then I am
      forgiven?&rdquo; he repeated, more softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was averted as he spoke, but he felt hen arm quiver; and when at
      last she lifted her head, their eyes met. Neither spoke, but in an instant
      Loder's arms were round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long, silent space they stood holding each other closely. Then, with
      a sharp movement, Eve freed Herself. Her color was still high, her eyes
      still peculiarly bright, but the bunch of violets she had worn in her belt
      had fallen to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John&mdash;&rdquo; she said, quickly; but on the word her breath caught. With a
      touch of nervousness she stooped to pick up the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder noticed both voice and gesture. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What were
      you going to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she made no answer. For a second longer she searched for the violets;
      then, as he bent to assist her, she stood up quickly and laughed&mdash;a
      short, embarrassed laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurd and nervous I am!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Like a schoolgirl instead
      of a woman of twenty-four. You must help me to be sensible.&rdquo; Her cheeks
      still burned, her manner was still excited, like one who holds an emotion
      or an impulse at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked at her uncertainly. &ldquo;Eve&mdash;&rdquo; he began afresh with his
      odd, characteristic perseverance, but she instantly checked him. There was
      a finality, a faint suggestion of fear, in her protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don't! I don't want explanations. I want to&mdash;to
      enjoy the moment without having things analyzed or smoothed away. Can't
      you understand? Can't you see that I'm wonderfully, terribly happy to&mdash;to
      have you&mdash;as you are!&rdquo; Again her voice broke&mdash;a break that might
      have been a laugh or a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound was an emotional crisis, as such a sound invariably is. It
      arrested and steadied her. For a moment she stood absolutely still; then,
      with something very closely resembling her old repose of manner, she
      stooped again and quietly picked up the flowers still lying at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;I must say what I've wanted to say all along.
      How does it feel to be a great man?&rdquo; Her manner was controlled, she looked
      at him evenly and directly; save for the faint vibration in her voice
      there was nothing to indicate the tumult of a moment ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder was still uncertain. He caught her hand, his eyes searching
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Eve&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Eve played the last card in her mysterious game. Laughing quickly and
      nervously, she freed her hand and laid it over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not one word! All this past fortnight has belonged to
      you; now it's my turn. To-day is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      And so, once again, the woman conquered. Whatever Eve's intentions were,
      whatever she wished to evade or ward off, she was successful in gaining
      her end. For more than two hours she kept Loder at her side. There may
      have been moments in those two hours when the tension was high, when the
      efforts she made to interest and hold him were somewhat strained. But if
      this was so, it escaped the notice of the one person concerned; for it was
      long after tea had been served, long after Eve had offered to do penance
      for her monopoly of him by driving him to Chilcote's club, that Loder
      realized with any degree of distinctness that it was she and not he who
      had taken the lead in their interview; that it was she and not he who had
      bridged the difficult silences and given a fresh direction to dangerous
      channels of talk. It was long before he recognized this; but it was still
      longer before he realized the far more potent fact that, without any
      coldness, without any lessening of the subtle consideration she always
      showed him, she had given him no further opportunity of making love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking continuously, elated with the sense of conflict still to come, he
      drove with her to the club. Considering that drive in the light of after
      events, his own frame of mind invariably filled him with incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eyes of any sane man his position was not worth an hour's purchase;
      yet in the blind self-confidence of the moment he would not have changed
      places with Fraide himself. The great song of Self was sounding in his
      ears as he drove through the crowded streets, conscious of the cool, crisp
      air, of Eve's close presence, of the numberless infinitesimal things that
      went to make up the value of life. It was this acknowledgment of
      personality that upheld him; the personality, the power that had carried
      him unswervingly through eleven colorless years; that had impelled him
      towards this new career when the new career had first been opened to him;
      that had hewn a way for him in this fresh existence against colossal odds.
      The indomitable force that had trampled out Chilcote's footmarks in public
      life, in private life&mdash;in love. It was a triumphant paean that
      clamored in his ears, something persistent and prophetic with an undernote
      of menace. The cry of the human soul that has dared to stand alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance was keen and bright as he waited for a moment at the carriage
      door and took Eve's hand before entering the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're dining out to-night?&rdquo; he said. His fingers, always tenacious and
      masterful, continued to hold hers. The compunction that had driven him
      temporarily towards sacrifice had passed. His pride, his confidence, and
      with them his desire, had flowed back in full measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve, watching him attentively, paled a little. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm
      dining with the Bramfells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time will you get home?&rdquo; He scarcely realized why he put the
      question. The song of Self still sounded triumphantly, and he responded
      without reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes held hers, his fingers pressed her hand; the intense mastery of
      his will passed through her in a sudden sense of fear. Her lips parted in
      deprecation, but he&mdash;closely attentive of her expression&mdash;spoke
      again quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I see you?&rdquo; he asked, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she was about to speak. She leaned forward, as if some thought long
      suppressed trembled on her lips; then her courage or her desire failed
      her. She leaned back, letting her lashes droop over her eyes. &ldquo;I shall be
      home at eleven,&rdquo; she said below her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder dined with Lakely at Chilcote's club; and so absorbing were the
      political interests of the hour&mdash;the resignation of Sir Robert
      Sefborough, the King's summoning of Fraide, the probable features of the
      new ministry&mdash;that it was after nine o'clock when at last he freed
      himself and drove to the &ldquo;Arcadian&rdquo; Theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of music came to him as he entered the theatre&mdash;light,
      measured music suggestive of tiny streams, toy lambs, and painted
      shepherdesses. It sounded singularly inappropriate to his mood&mdash;as
      inappropriate as the theatre itself with its gay gilding, its pale tones
      of pink and blue. It was the setting of a different world&mdash;a world of
      laughter, light thoughts, and shallow impulses, in which he had no part.
      He halted for an instant outside the box to which the attendant had shown
      him; then, as the door was thrown open, he straightened himself resolutely
      and stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the interval between the first and second acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The box was in shadow, and Loder's first impression was of voices and
      rustling skirts, broken in upon by the murmur of frequent, amused
      laughter; later, as his eyes grew accustomed to the light, he
      distinguished the occupants&mdash;two women and a man. The man was
      speaking as he entered, and the story he was relating was evidently
      interesting from the faint exclamations of question and delight that
      punctuated it in the listeners' higher, softer voices. As the new-comer
      entered they all three turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here comes the legislator!&rdquo; exclaimed Leonard Kaine. For it was he
      who formed the male element in the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Revolutionary, Lennie!&rdquo; Lillian corrected, softly. &ldquo;Bramfell says he
      has changed the whole face of things&mdash;&rdquo; She laughed softly and
      meaningly as she closed her fan. &ldquo;So good of you to come, Jack!&rdquo; she
      added. &ldquo;Let me introduce you to Miss Esseltyn; I don't think you two have
      met. This is Mr. Chilcote, Mary&mdash;the great, new Mr. Chilcote.&rdquo; Again
      she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder bowed and moved to the front of the box, nodding to Kaine as he
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only for an hour,&rdquo; he explained to Lillian. &ldquo;I have an appointment
      for eleven.&rdquo; He turned and bowed to the third occupant of the box&mdash;a
      remarkably young and well-dressed girl with wide-awake eyes and a
      retrousse nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an hour! Oh, how unkind! How should I punish him, Lennie?&rdquo; Lillian
      looked round at Kaine with a lingering, caressing glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent towards her in quick response and answered in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and replied in an equally low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, to whom both remarks had been inaudible dropped into the vacant
      seat beside Mary Esseltyn. He had the unsettled feeling that things were
      not falling out exactly as he had calculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the play like?&rdquo; he hazarded as he looked towards his companion.
      At all times social trivialities bored him; to-night they were
      intolerable. He had come to fight, but all at once it seemed that there
      was no opponent. Lillian's attitude disturbed him; her careless
      graciousness, her evident ignoring of him for Kaine, might mean nothing&mdash;but
      also it might mean much.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he speculated as he put his question and spurred his attention towards
      the girl's answer; but with the speculation came the resolve to hold his
      own&mdash;to meet his enemy upon whatever ground she chose to appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at him with interest. She, too, had heard of his triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good play,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;I like it better than the book.
      You've read the book, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Loder tried hard to fix his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's amusing&mdash;but far-fetched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; He picked up the programme lying on the edge of the box. His
      ears were strained to catch the tone of Lillian's voice as she laughed and
      whispered with Kaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; men exchanging identities, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and caught the girl's self-possessed glance. &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Then again he looked away. It was intolerable this feeling of
      being caged up! A sense of anger crept through his mind. It almost seemed
      that Lillian had brought him there to prove that she had finished with him&mdash;had
      cast him aside, having used him for the day's excitement as she had used
      her poodles, her Persian cats, her crystal-gazing. All at once the
      impotency and uncertainty of his position goaded him. Turning swiftly in
      his seat, he glanced back to where she sat, slowly swaying her fan, her
      pale, golden hair and her pale-colored gown delicately silhouetted against
      the background of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your idea of the play, Lillian?&rdquo; he said, abruptly. To his own
      ears there was a note of challenge in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round languidly. &ldquo;Oh, it's quite amusing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It makes
      a delicious farce&mdash;absolutely French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;French?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. Don't you think so, Lennie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite,&rdquo; Kaine agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They mean that it's so very light&mdash;and yet so very subtle, Mr.
      Chilcote,&rdquo; Mary Esseltyn explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then my imagination was at fault. I thought the piece
      was serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious!&rdquo; Lillian smiled again. &ldquo;Why, where's your sense of humor? The
      motive of the play debars all seriousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder looked down at the programme still between his hands. &ldquo;What is the
      motive?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lillian waved her fan once or twice, then closed it softly. &ldquo;Love is the
      motive,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the balancing&mdash;the adjusting of impression and inspirations, of
      all processes in life, the most delicately fine. The simple sound of the
      word &ldquo;love&rdquo; coming at that precise juncture changed the whole current of
      Loder's thought. It fell like a seed; and like a seed in ultra-productive
      soil, it bore fruit with amazing rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word itself was small and the manner in which it was spoken trivial,
      but Loder's mind was attracted and held by it. The last time it had met
      his ears his environment had been vastly different; and this echo of it in
      an uncongenial atmosphere stung him to resentment. The vision of Eve, the
      thought of Eve, became suddenly dominant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love?&rdquo; he repeated, coldly. &ldquo;So love is the motive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; This time it was Kaine who responded in his methodical, contented
      voice. &ldquo;The motive of the play is love, as Lillian says. And when was love
      ever serious in a three-act comedy&mdash;on or off the stage?&rdquo; He leaned
      forward in his seat, screwed in his eye-glass, and lazily scanned the
      stalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra was playing a Hungarian dance&mdash;its erratic harmonies
      and wild alternations of expression falling abruptly across the pinks and
      blues, the gilding and lights of the pretty, conventional theatre.
      Something in the suggestion of unfitness appealed to Loder. It was the
      force of the real as opposed to the ideal. With a new expression on his
      face, he turned again to Kaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how does it work?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This treatment that you find so&mdash;French?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice as well as his expression had changed. He still spoke quietly,
      but he spoke with interest. He was no longer conscious of his vague and
      uneasiness; a fresh chord had been struck in his mind, and his curiosity
      had responded to it. For the first time it occurred to him that love&mdash;the
      dangerous, mysterious garden whose paths had so suddenly stretched out
      before his own feet&mdash;was a pleasure-ground that possessed many doors&mdash;and
      an infinite number of keys. He was stirred by the desire to peer through
      another entrance than his own, to see the secret, alluring byways from
      another stand-point. He waited with interest for the answer to his
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second or two Kaine continued to survey the house; then his
      eye-glass dropped from his eye and he turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To understand the thing,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly, &ldquo;you must have read the
      book. Have you read the book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Kaine,&rdquo; Mary Esseltyn interrupted, &ldquo;Mr. Chilcote hasn't read the
      book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lillian laughed. &ldquo;Outline the story for him, Lennie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I love to
      see other people taking pains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kaine glanced at her admiringly. &ldquo;Well, to begin with,&rdquo; he said, amiably,
      &ldquo;two men, an artist and a millionaire, exchange lives. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may presume that he does see, Lennie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! Well, then, as I say, these beggars change identities. They're as
      like as pins; and to all appearances one chap's the other chap&mdash;and
      the other chap's the first chap. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder laughed. The newly quickened interest was enhanced by treading on
      dangerous ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they change for a lark, of course, but there's one fact they both
      overlook. They're men, you know, and they forget these little things!&rdquo; He
      laughed delightedly. &ldquo;They overlook the fact that one of 'em has got a
      wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a crash of music from the orchestra. Loder sat straighter in his
      seat; he was conscious that the blood had rushed into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed?&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;One of them had a wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Again Kaine chuckled. &ldquo;And the point of the joke is that the
      wife is the least larky person under the sun. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A second hot wave passed over Loder's face; a sense of mental disgust
      filled him. This, then, was the wonderful garden seen from another
      stand-point! He looked from Lillian, graceful, sceptical, and shallow, to
      the young girl beside him, so frankly modern in her appreciation of life.
      This, then, was love as seen by the eyes of the world&mdash;the world that
      accepts, judges, and condemns in a slang phrase or two! Very slowly the
      blood receded from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the end of the story?&rdquo; he asked, in a strained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end? Oh, usual end, of course. Chap makes a mess of things and the
      bubble bursts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the end of the wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of the wife?&rdquo; Lillian broke in, with a little laugh. &ldquo;Why, the
      end of all stupid people who, instead of going through life with a lot of
      delightfully human stumbles, come just one big cropper. She naturally ends
      in the divorce court!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed boisterously. Then laughter, story, and denouement were
      all drowned in a tumultuous crash of music. The orchestra ceased; there
      was a slight hum of applause; and the curtain rose on the second act of
      the comedy.

    <p>
      A few minutes before the curtain fell on the second act of 'Other Men's
      Shoes' Loder rose from his seat and made his apologies to Lillian.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any other moment he might have pondered over her manner of accepting
      them&mdash;the easy indifference with which she let him go. But vastly
      keener issues were claiming his attention, issues whose results were wide
      and black.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the theatre, and, refusing the overtures of cabmen, set himself to
      walk to Chilcote's house. His face was hard and emotionless as he hurried
      forward, but the chaos in his mind found expression in the unevenness of
      his pace. To a strong man the confronting of difficulties is never
      alarming and is often fraught with inspiration; but this applies
      essentially to the difficulties evolved through the weakness, the folly,
      or the force of another; when they arise from within the matter is of
      another character. It is in presence of his own soul&mdash;and in that
      presence alone&mdash;that a man may truly measure himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Loder walked onward, treading the whole familiar length of
      traffic-filled street, he realized for the first time that he was standing
      before that solemn tribunal that the hour had come when he must answer to
      himself for himself. The longer and deeper an oblivion the more painful
      the awakening. For months the song of self had beaten about his ears,
      deadening all other sounds; now abruptly that song had ceased&mdash;not
      considerately, not lingeringly, but with a suddenness that made the
      succeeding silence very terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked onward, keeping his direction unseeingly. He was passing through
      the fire as surely as though actual flames rose about his feet; and
      whatever the result, whatever the fibre of the man who emerged from the
      ordeal, the John Loder who had hewn his way through the past weeks would
      exist no more. The triumphant egotist&mdash;the strong man&mdash;who, by
      his own strength, had kept his eyes upon one point, refusing to see in
      other directions, had ceased to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keen though it was, his realization of this crisis in his life had come
      with characteristic slowness. When Lillian Astrupp had given her dictum,
      when the music of the orchestra had ceased and the curtain risen on the
      second act of the play, nothing but a sense of stupefaction had filled his
      mind. In that moment the great song was silenced, not by any portentous
      episode, not by any incident that could have lent dignity to its end, but&mdash;with
      the full measure of life's irony&mdash;by a trivial social commonplace. In
      the first sensation of blank loss his faculties had been numbed; in the
      quarter of an hour that followed the rise of the curtain he had sat
      staring at the stage, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, filled with the
      enormity of the void that suddenly surrounded him. Then, from habit, from
      constitutional tendency, he had begun slowly and perseveringly to draw
      first one thread and then another from the tangle of his thoughts&mdash;to
      forge with doubt and difficulty the chain that was to draw him towards the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon this same incomplete and yet tenacious chain that his mind
      worked as he traversed the familiar streets and at last gained the house
      he had so easily learned to call home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he inserted the latch-key and felt it move smoothly in the lock, a
      momentary revolt against his own judgment, his own censorship swung him
      sharply towards reaction. But it is only the blind who can walk without a
      tremor on the edge of an abyss, and there was no longer a bandage across
      his eyes. The reaction flared up like a strip of lighted paper; then, like
      a strip of lighted paper, it dropped back to ashes. He pushed the door
      open and slowly crossed the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mounting of a staircase is often the index to a man's state of mind.
      As Loder ascended the stairs of Chilcote's house his shoulders lacked
      their stiffness, his head was no longer erect; he moved as though his feet
      were weighted. He had ceased to be the man of achievement whose smallest
      opinion compels consideration; in the privacy of solitude he was the mere
      human flotsam to which he had once compared himself&mdash;the flotsam
      that, dreaming it has found a harbor, wakes to find itself the prey of the
      incoming tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused at the head of the stairs to rally his resolutions; then, still
      walking heavily, he passed down the corridor to Eve's room. It was
      suggestive of his character that, having made his decision, he did not
      dally over its performance. Without waiting to knock, he turned the handle
      and walked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked precisely as it always looked, but to Loder the rich, subdued
      coloring of books and flowers&mdash;the whole air of culture and repose
      that the place conveyed&mdash;seemed to hold a deeper meaning than before;
      and it was on the instant that his eyes, crossing the inanimate objects,
      rested on their owner that the true force of his position, the enormity of
      the task before him, made itself plain. Realization came to him with
      vivid, overwhelming force; and it must be accounted to his credit, in the
      summing of his qualities, that then, in that moment of trial, the thought
      of retreat, the thought of yielding did not present itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve was standing by the mantel-piece. She wore a beautiful gown, a long
      string of diamonds was twisted about her neck, and her soft, black hair
      was coiled high after a foreign fashion, and held in place by a large
      diamond comb. As he entered she turned hastily, almost nervously, and
      looked at him with the rapid, searching glance he had learned to expect
      from her; then, almost directly, her expression changed to one of quick
      concern. With a faint exclamation of alarm she stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You look like a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder made no answer. Moving into the room, he paused by the oak table
      that stood between the fireplace and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made an unconscious tableau as they stood there&mdash;he with his
      hard, set face, she with her heightened color, her inexplicably bright
      eyes. They stood completely silent for a space&mdash;a space that for
      Loder held no suggestion of time; then, finding the tension unbearable,
      Eve spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is any thing wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had he been less engrossed the intensity of her concern might have struck
      him; but in a mind so harassed as his there was only room for one
      consideration&mdash;the consideration of himself. The sense of her
      question reached him, but its significance left him untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything wrong?&rdquo; she reiterated for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      By an effort he raised his eyes. No man, he thought, since the beginning
      of the world was ever set a task so cruel as his. Painfully and slowly his
      lips parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything in the world is wrong,&rdquo; he said, in a slow, hard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve said nothing but her color suddenly deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder was unobservant. But with the dogged resolution that marked
      him he forced himself to his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You despise lies,&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;Tell me what you would think of a
      man whose whole life was one elaborated lie?&rdquo; The words were slightly
      exaggerated, but their utterance, their painfully brusque sincerity,
      precluded all suggestion of effect. Resolutely holding her gaze he
      repeated his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me! Answer me! I want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve's attitude was difficult to read. She stood twisting the string of
      diamonds between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me?&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to look at him for a moment; then, as if some fresh impulse
      moved her, she turned away from him towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&mdash;I&mdash;I could not set myself to judge&mdash;any
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder held himself rigidly in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;I was at the `Arcadian' to-night. The play was
      'Other Men's Shoes.' I suppose you've read the book 'Other Men's Shoes'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning on the mantel-piece and her face was invisible to him.
      &ldquo;Yes, I have read it,&rdquo; she said, without looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the story of an extraordinary likeness between two men. Do you
      believe such a likeness possible? Do you think such a thing could exist?&rdquo;
       He spoke with difficulty; his brain and tongue both felt numb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve let the diamond chain slip from her fingers. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said,
      nervously. &ldquo;Yes, I do believe it. Such things have been&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder caught at the words. &ldquo;You're quite right,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;You're
      quite right. The thing is possible&mdash;I've proved it. I know a man so
      like me that you, even you, could not tell us apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve was silent, still averting her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dire difficulty he labored on. &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he began once more, &ldquo;such a
      likeness is a serious thing&mdash;a terrible danger&mdash;a terrible
      temptation. Those who have no experience of it cannot possibly gauge its
      pitfalls&mdash;&rdquo; Again he paused, but again the silent figure by the
      fireplace gave him no help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly, &ldquo;if you only knew, if you only guessed what
      I'm trying to say&mdash;&rdquo; The perplexity, the whole harassed suffering of
      his mind showed in the words. Loder, the strong, the resourceful, the
      self-contained, was palpably, painfully at a loss. There was almost a note
      of appeal in the vibration of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Eve, standing by the fireplace, heard and understood. In that moment
      of comprehension all that had held her silent, all the conflicting motives
      that had forbidden speech, melted away before the unconscious demand for
      help. Quietly and yet quickly she turned, her whole face transfigured by a
      light that seemed to shine from within&mdash;something singularly soft and
      tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no need to say anything,&rdquo; she said, simply, &ldquo;because I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came quietly, as most great revelations come. Her voice was low and
      free from any excitement, her face beautiful in its complete
      unconsciousness of self. In that supreme moment all her thought, all her
      sympathy was for the man&mdash;and his suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Loder there was a space of incredulity; then his brain slowly swung to
      realization. &ldquo;You know?&rdquo; he repeated, blankly. &ldquo;You know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without answering she walked to a cabinet that stood in the window,
      unlocked a drawer, and drew out several sheets of flimsy white paper,
      crumpled in places and closely covered with writing. Without a word she
      carried them back and held them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took them in silence, scanned them, then looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a long, worthless pause their eyes met. It was as if each looked
      speechlessly into the other's heart, seeing the passions, the
      contradictions, the shortcomings that went to the making of both. In that
      silence they drew closer together than they could have done through a
      torrent of words. There was no asking of forgiveness, no elaborate
      confession on either side; in the deep, eloquent pause they mutually saw
      and mutually understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came into the morning-room to-day,&rdquo; Eve said, at last, &ldquo;and saw
      Lillian Astrupp reading that telegram, nothing could have seemed further
      from me than the thought that I should follow her example. It was not
      until afterwards; not until&mdash;he came into the room; until I saw that
      you, as I believed, had fallen back again from what I respected to what I
      despised&mdash;that I knew how human I really was. As I watched them laugh
      and talk I felt suddenly that I was alone again&mdash;terribly alone. I&mdash;I
      think&mdash;I believe I was jealous in that moment&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she broke in quickly on the word. &ldquo;I felt different in that moment. I
      didn't care about honor&mdash;or things like honor. After they had gone it
      seemed to me that I had missed something&mdash;something that they
      possessed. Oh, you don't know what a woman feels when she is jealous!&rdquo;
       Again she paused. &ldquo;It was then that the telegram, and the thought of
      Lillian's amused smile as she had read it, came to my mind. Feeling as I
      did&mdash;acting on what I felt&mdash;I crossed to the bureau and picked
      it up. In one second I had seen enough to make it impossible to draw back.
      Oh, it may have been dishonorable, it may have been mean, but I wonder if
      any woman in the world would have done otherwise! I crumpled up the papers
      just as they were and carried them to my own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the first to the last word of Eve's story Loder's eyes never left her
      face. Instantly she had finished his voice broke forth in irrepressible
      question. In that wonderful space of time he had learned many things. All
      his deductions, all his apprehensions had been scattered and disproved. He
      had seen the true meaning of Lillian Astrupp's amused indifference&mdash;the
      indifference of a variable, flippant nature that, robbed of any real
      weapon for mischief, soon tires of a game that promises to be too arduous.
      He saw all this and understood it with a rapidity born of the moment;
      nevertheless, when Eve ceased to speak the question that broke from him
      was not connected with this great discovery&mdash;was not even suggestive
      of it. It was something quite immaterial to any real issue, but something
      that overshadowed every consideration in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me your first thought? Your first thought after the
      shock and the surprise&mdash;when you remembered me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a fresh pause, but one of very short duration; then Eve met his
      glance fearlessly and frankly. The same pride and dignity, the same
      indescribable tenderness that had responded to his first appeal shone in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My first thought was a great thankfulness,&rdquo; she said, simply. &ldquo;A
      thankfulness that you&mdash;that no man&mdash;could ever understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0032" id="link2H_4_0032">

    <h2>
      XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      As she finished speaking Eve did not lower her eyes. To her there was no
      suggestion of shame in her thoughts or her words; but to Loder, watching
      and listening, there was a perilous meaning contained in both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thankfulness?&rdquo; he repeated, slowly. From his newly stirred sense of
      responsibility pity and sympathy were gradually rising. He had never seen
      Eve as he saw her now, and his vision was all the clearer for the long
      oblivion. With a poignant sense of compassion and remorse, the knowledge
      of her youth came to him&mdash;the youth that some women preserve in the
      midst of the world, when circumstances have permitted them to see much but
      to experience little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thankfulness?&rdquo; he said again, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight smile touched her lips. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, softly.
      &ldquo;Thankfulness that my trust had been rightly placed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke simply and confidently, but the words struck Loder more sharply
      than any accusation. With a heavy sense of bitterness and renunciation he
      moved slowly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, very gently, &ldquo;you don't know what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had lowered her eyes as he came towards her; now again she lifted them
      in a swift, upward glance. For the first time since he had entered the
      room a slight look of personal doubt and uneasiness showed in her face.
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he answered nothing. He had found his first explanation
      overwhelming; now suddenly it seemed to him that his present difficulty
      was more impossible to surmount. &ldquo;I came here to-night to tell you
      something,&rdquo; he began, at last, &ldquo;but so far I have only said half&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, half.&rdquo; He repeated the word quickly, avoiding the question in her
      eyes. Then, conscious of the need for explanation, he plunged into rapid
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fraud like mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has only one safeguard, one justification&mdash;a
      boundless audacity. Once shake that audacity and the whole motive power
      crumbles. It was to make the audacity impossible&mdash;to tell you the
      truth and make it impossible&mdash;that I came to-night. The fact that you
      already knew made the telling easier&mdash;but it altered nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve raised her head, but he went resolutely on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have seen into my own life, into my own mind, and
      my ideas have been very roughly shaken into new places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never make so colossal a mistake as when we imagine that we know
      ourselves. Months ago, when your husband first proposed this scheme to me,
      I was, according to my own conception, a solitary being vastly ill-used by
      Fate, who, with a fine stoicism, was leading a clean life. That was what I
      believed; but there, at the very outset, I deceived myself. I was simply a
      man who shut himself up because he cherished a grudge against life, and
      who lived honestly because he had a constitutional distaste for vice. My
      first feeling when I saw your husband was one of self-righteous contempt,
      and that has been my attitude all along. I have often marvelled at the
      flood of intolerance that has rushed over me at sight of him&mdash;the
      violent desire that has possessed me to look away from his weakness and
      banish the knowledge of it; but now I understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now what the feeling meant. The knowledge came to me to-night. It
      meant that I turned away from his weakness because deep within myself
      something stirred in recognition of it. Humanity is really much simpler
      than we like to think, and human impulses have an extraordinary
      fundamental connection. Weakness is egotism&mdash;but so is strength.
      Chilcote has followed his vice; I have followed my ambition. It will take
      a higher judgment than yours or mine to say which of us has been the more
      selfish man.&rdquo; He paused and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was watching him intently. Some of the meaning in his face had found a
      pained, alarmed reflection in her own. But the awe and wonder of the
      morning's discovery still colored her mind too vividly to allow of other
      considerations possessing their proper value. The thrill of exultation
      with which the misgivings born of Chilcote's vice had dropped away from
      her mental image of Loder was still too absorbing to be easily dominated.
      She loved, and as if by a miracle her love had been justified! For the
      moment the justification was all-sufficing. Something of confidence&mdash;something
      of the innocence that comes not from ignorance of evil but from a mind
      singularly uncontaminated&mdash;blinded her to the danger of her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder, waiting apprehensively for some aid, some expression of opinion,
      became gradually conscious of this lack of realization. Moved by a fresh
      impulse, he crossed the small space that divided them and caught her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;I have been trying to analyze myself and give you
      the results; but I sha'n't try any more; I shall be quite plain with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the first moment I took your husband's place I was ambitious. You
      unconsciously aroused the feeling when you brought me Fraide's message on
      the first night. You aroused it by your words&mdash;but more strongly,
      though more obscurely, by your underlying antagonism. On that night,
      though I did not know it, I took up my position&mdash;I made my
      determination. Do you know what that determination was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the desire to stamp out Chilcote's footmarks with my own&mdash;to
      prove that personality is the great force capable of everything. I forgot
      to reckon that when we draw largely upon Fate she generally extorts a
      crushing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First came the wish for your respect; then the desire to stand well with
      such men as Fraide&mdash;to feel the stir of emulation and competition&mdash;to
      prove myself strong in the one career I knew myself really fitted for. For
      a time the second ambition overshadowed the first, but the first was bound
      to reassert itself; and in a moment of egotism I conceived the notion of
      winning your enthusiasm as well as your respect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve's face, alert and questioning, suddenly paled as a doubt crossed her
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was only&mdash;only to stand well with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believed it was only the desire to stand well with you; I believed it
      until the night of my speech&mdash;if you can credit anything so absurd&mdash;then
      on that night, as I came up the stairs to the gallery and saw you standing
      there, the blindness fell away and I knew that I loved you.&rdquo; As he said
      the last words he released her hands and turned aside, missing the quick
      wave of joy and color that crossed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it, but it made no difference; I was only moved to a higher
      self-glorification. I touched supremacy that night. But as we drove home I
      experienced the strangest coincidence of my life. You remember the block
      in the traffic at Piccadilly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Eve bent her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I looked out of the carriage window to discover its cause the
      first man I saw was&mdash;Chilcote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve started slightly. This swift, unexpected linking of Chilcote's name
      with the most exalted moment of her life stirred her unpleasantly. Some
      glimmering of Loder's intention in so linking it, broke through the web of
      disturbed and conflicting thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him on that night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the sight chilled me. It was a big drop from supremacy to the
      remembrance of&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily she put out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't pity me! The sight of him
      came just in time. I had a reaction in that moment, and, such as it was, I
      acted on it. I went to him next morning and told him that the thing must
      end. But then&mdash;even then&mdash;I shirked being honest with myself. I
      had meant to tell him that it must end because I had grown to love you,
      but my pride rose up and tied my tongue. I could not humiliate myself. I
      put the case before him in another light. It was a tussle of wills&mdash;and
      I won; but the victory was not what it should have been. That was proved
      to-day when he returned to tell me of the loss of this telegram. It wasn't
      the fear that Lady Astrupp had found it; it wasn't to save the position
      that I jumped at the chance of coming back; it was to feel the joy of
      living, the joy of seeing you&mdash;if only for a day!&rdquo; For one second he
      turned towards her, then as abruptly he turned away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was still thinking of myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was still utterly
      self-centred when I came to this room today and allowed you to talk to me&mdash;when
      I asked you to see me to-night as we parted at the club. I sha'n't tell
      you the thoughts that unconsciously were in my mind when I asked that
      favor. You must understand without explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the theatre with Lady Astrupp ostensibly to find out how the
      land lay in her direction&mdash;really to heighten my self-esteem. But
      there Fate&mdash;or the power we like to call by that name&mdash;was lying
      in wait for me, ready to claim the first interest in the portion of life I
      had dared to borrow.&rdquo; He said this slowly, as if measuring each word. He
      did not glance towards Eve as he had done in his previous pause. His whole
      manner seemed oppressed by the gravity of what he had still to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if a man has ever seen more in half an hour than I have
      to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm speaking of mental seeing, of course. In this
      play, 'Other Men's Shoes,' two men change identities&mdash;as Chilcote and
      I have done&mdash;but in doing so they overlook one fact&mdash;The fact
      that one of them has a wife! That's not my way of putting it; it's the way
      it was put to me by one of Lady Astrupp's party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Eve looked up. The doubt and question in her eyes had grown
      unmistakably. As he ceased to speak her lips parted quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, with sudden conviction, &ldquo;you're trying to say something&mdash;something
      that's terribly hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without raising his head, Loder answered her. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the
      hardest thing a man ever said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was short, almost brusque, but to ears sharpened by instinct it
      was eloquent. Without a word Eve took a step forward, and, standing quite
      close to him, laid both hands on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space they stood silent, she with her face lifted, he with averted
      eyes. Then very gently he raised his hands and tried to unclasp her
      fingers. There was scarcely any color visible in his face, and by a
      curious effect of emotion it seemed that lines, never before noticeable,
      had formed about his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Eve asked, apprehensively. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a swift, involuntary movement she had tightened the pressure of her
      fingers; and, without using force, it was impossible for Loder to unloose
      them. With his hands pressed irresolutely over hers, he looked down into
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I sat in the theatre to-night, Eve,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;all the
      pictures I had formed of life shifted. Without desiring it, without
      knowing it, my whole point of view was changed. I suddenly saw things by
      the world's search-light instead of by my own miserable candle. I suddenly
      saw things for you&mdash;instead of for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve's eyes widened and darkened, but she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suddenly saw the unpardonable wrong that I have done you&mdash;the
      imperative duty of cutting it short.&rdquo; He spoke very slowly, in a dull,
      mechanical voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve&mdash;her eyes still wide, her face pained and alarmed&mdash;withdrew
      her hands from his shoulders. &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; she said, with difficulty, &ldquo;that
      it is going to end? That you are going away? That you are giving
      everything up? Oh, but you can't! You can't!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with sudden
      excitement, her fears suddenly overmastering her incredulity. &ldquo;You can't!
      You mustn't! The only proof that could have interfered&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't thinking of the proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then of what? Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Of our love,&rdquo; he said, steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She colored deeply. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she stammered; &ldquo;why? We have done no wrong.
      We need do no wrong. We would be friends&mdash;nothing more; and I&mdash;oh,
      I so need a friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For almost the first time in Loder's knowledge of her, her voice broke,
      her control deserted her. She stood before him in all the pathos of her
      lonely girlhood&mdash;her empty life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revelation touched him with sudden poignancy; the real strength that
      lay beneath his faults, the chivalry buried under years of callousness,
      stirred at the birth of a new emotion. The resolution preserved at such a
      cost, the sacrifice that had seemed wellnigh impossible, all at once took
      on a different shape. What before had been a barren duty became suddenly a
      sacred right. Holding out his arms, he drew her to him as if she had been
      a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;I have learned to-night how fully a woman's life
      is at the mercy of the world&mdash;and how scanty that mercy is. If
      circumstances had been different, I believe&mdash;I am convinced&mdash;I
      would have made you a good husband&mdash;would have used my right to
      protect you as well as a man could use it. And now that things are
      different, I want&mdash;I should like&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated a very little.
      &ldquo;Now that I have no right to protect you&mdash;except the right my love
      gives&mdash;I want to guard you as closely from all that is sordid as any
      husband could guard his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In life there are really only two broad issues&mdash;right and wrong.
      Whatever we may say, whatever we may profess to believe, we know that our
      action is always a choice between right and wrong. A month ago&mdash;a
      week ago&mdash;I would have despised a man who could talk like this&mdash;and
      have thought myself strong for despising him. Now I know that strength is
      something more than the trampling of others into the dust that we
      ourselves may have a clear road; that it is something much harder and much
      less triumphant than that&mdash;that it is standing aside to let somebody
      else pass on. Eve,&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly, &ldquo;I'm trying to do this for
      you. Don't you see? Don't you understand? The easy course, the happy
      course, would be to let things drift. Every instinct is calling to me to
      take that course&mdash;to go on as I have gone, trading on Chilcote's
      weakness and your generosity. But I won't do it! I can't do it!&rdquo; With a
      swift impulse he loosed his arms and held her away from him. &ldquo;Eve, it's
      the first time I have put another human being before myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve kept her head bent. Painful, inaudible sobs were shaking her from head
      to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's something in you&mdash;something unconscious&mdash;something high
      and fine, that holds me back&mdash;that literally bars the way. Eve, can't
      you see that I'm fighting&mdash;fighting hard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After he had spoken there was silence&mdash;a long, painful silence&mdash;during
      which Eve waged the battle that so many of her sex have waged before; the
      battle in which words are useless and tears of no account. She looked very
      slight, very young, very forlorn, as she stood there. Then, in the
      oppressive sense of waiting that filled the whole room, she looked up at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was stained with tears, her thick, black lashes were still wet
      with them; but her expression, as her eyes met Loder's, was a strange
      example of the courage, the firmness, the power of sacrifice that may be
      hidden in a fragile vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, for in such a moment words do not come easily, but with
      the simplest, most submissive, most eloquent gesture in the world she set
      his perplexity to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his hand between hers, she lifted it and for a long, silent space
      held it against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0033" id="link2H_4_0033">

    <h2>
      XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a while there was silence; then Loder, bitterly aware that he had
      conquered, poignantly conscious of the appeal that Eve's attitude made,
      found further endurance impossible. Gently freeing his hand, he moved away
      from her to the fireplace, taking up the position that she had first
      occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;I haven't finished yet. I haven't said
      everything. I'm going to tax your courage further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a touch of pained alarm, Eve lifted her head. &ldquo;Further?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder shrank from the expression on her face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, with
      difficulty. &ldquo;There's still another point to be faced. The matter doesn't
      end with my going back. To have the situation fully saved, Chilcote must
      return&mdash;Chilcote must be brought to realize his responsibilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve's lips parted in dumb dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be done,&rdquo; he went on hurriedly, &ldquo;and we have got to do it&mdash;you
      and I.&rdquo; He turned and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I could do nothing. What could I do?&rdquo; Her voice failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you could do everything. He is morally weak, but
      he has one sensitive point&mdash;the fear of a public exposure. Once make
      it plain to him that you know his secret, and you can compel him to
      whatever course of action you select. It was to ask you to do this&mdash;to
      beg you to do this&mdash;that I came to you to-night. I know that it's
      demanding more than a woman's resolution&mdash;more than a woman's
      strength. But you are like no woman in the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; he cried, with sudden vehemence, &ldquo;can't you see that it's
      imperative&mdash;the one thing to save us both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly as he had begun, and again a painful silence filled
      the room. Then, as before, Eve moved instinctively towards him, but this
      time her steps were slow and uncertain. Nearing his side, she put out her
      hand as if for comfort and support; and, feeling his fingers tighten round
      it, stood for a moment resting in the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said at last, very slowly. &ldquo;I understand. When will
      you take me to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Loder said nothing, not daring to trust his voice; then he
      answered, low and abruptly. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, at once! Now, this
      moment, if I may. And&mdash;and remember that I know what it costs you.&rdquo;
       As if imbued with fear that his courage might fail him, he suddenly
      released her hand, and, crossing the room to where a long, dark cloak lay
      as she had thrown it on her return home, he picked it up, walked to her
      side, and silently wrapped it about her. Then, still acting automatically,
      he moved to the door, opened it, and stood aside while she passed out into
      the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In complete silence they descended the stairs and passed to the hall door.
      There Crapham, who had returned to his duties since Loder's entrance, came
      quickly forward with an offer of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Loder dismissed him curtly; and with something of the confusion bred
      of Chilcote's regime, the man drew back towards the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a hasty movement Loder stepped forward, and, opening the door,
      admitted a breath of chill air. Then on the threshold he paused. It was
      his first sign of hesitation&mdash;the one instant in which nature
      rebelled against the conscience so tardily awakened. He stood motionless
      for a moment, and it is doubtful whether even Eve fully fathomed the
      bitterness of his renunciation&mdash;the blackness of the night that
      stretched before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him was everything; before him, nothing. The everything symbolized
      by the luxurious house, the eagerly attentive servants, the pleasant
      atmosphere of responsibility; the nothing represented by the broad public
      thoroughfare, the passing figures, each unconscious of and uninterested in
      his existence. As an interloper he had entered this house; as an
      interloper&mdash;a masquerader&mdash;he had played his part, lived his
      hour, proved himself; as an interloper he was now passing back into the
      dim world of unrealized hopes and unachieved ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood rigidly quiet, his strong figure silhouetted against the lighted
      hall, his face cold and set; then, with a touch of fatality, Chance cut
      short his struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      An empty hansom wheeled round the corner of the square; the cabman, seeing
      him, raised his whip in query, and involuntarily he nodded an
      acquiescence. A moment later he had helped Eve into the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middle Temple Lane!&rdquo; he directed, pausing on the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middle Temple Lane is opposite to Clifford's Inn,&rdquo; he explained as he
      took his place beside her. &ldquo;When we get out there we have only to cross
      Fleet Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve bent her head in token that she understood, and the cab moved out into
      the roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a few minutes the neighborhood of Grosvenor Square was exchanged
      for the noisier and more crowded one of Piccadilly, but either the cabman
      was overcautious or the horse was below the average, for they made but
      slow progress through the more crowded streets. To the two sitting in
      silence the pace was wellnigh unbearable. With every added movement the
      tension grew. The methodical care with which they moved seemed like the
      tightening of a string already strained to breaking-point, yet neither
      spoke&mdash;because neither had the courage necessary for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice as they traversed the Strand, Loder made a movement as if to
      break the silence, but nothing followed it. He continued to lean forward
      with a certain dogged stiffness, his clasped hands resting on the doors of
      the cab, his eyes staring straight ahead. Not once, as they threaded their
      way, did he dare to glance at Eve, though every movement, every stir of
      her garments, was forced upon his consciousness by his acutely awakened
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last they drew up before the dark archway of Middle Temple Lane,
      he descended hastily. And as he mechanically turned to protect Eve's dress
      from the wheel, he looked at her fully for the first time since their
      enterprise had been undertaken. As he looked he felt his heart sink. He
      had expected to see the marks of suffering on her face, but the expression
      he saw suggested something more than mere mental pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rich color that usually deepened and softened the charm of her
      beauty had been erased as if by a long illness; and against the new pallor
      of her skin her blue eyes, her black hair and eyebrows, seemed startlingly
      dark. A chill colder than remorse, a chill that bordered upon actual fear,
      touched Loder in that moment. With the first impulsive gesture he had
      allowed himself, he touched her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve&mdash;&rdquo; he began, unsteadily; then the word died off his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a sound, almost without a movement, she returned his glance, and
      something in her eyes checked what he might have said. In that one
      expressive look he understood all she had desired, all she had renounced&mdash;the
      full extent of the ordeal she had consented to, and the motive that had
      compelled her consent. He drew back with the heavy sense that repentance
      and pity were equally futile&mdash;equally out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still in silence she stepped to the pavement and stood aside while Loder
      dismissed the cab. To both there was something symbolic, something
      prophetic, in the dismissal. Without intention and almost unconsciously
      they drew closer together as the horse turned, its hoofs clattering on the
      roadway, its harness jingling; and, still without realization, they looked
      after the vehicle as it moved away down the long, shadowed thoroughfare
      towards the lights and the crowds that they had left. At last
      involuntarily they turned towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Loder said, abruptly. &ldquo;It's only across the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleet Street is generally very quiet, once midnight is passed; and Eve had
      no need of guidance or protection as they crossed the pavement, shining
      like ice in the lamplight. They crossed it slowly, walking apart; for the
      dread of physical contact that had possessed them in the cab seemed to
      have fallen on them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inquisitiveness has little place in the region of the city, and they
      gained the opposite footpath unnoticed by the casual passer-by. Then,
      still holding apart, they reached and entered Clifford's Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the entrance they paused, and Eve shivered involuntarily. &ldquo;How gray
      it is!&rdquo; she said, faintly. &ldquo;And how cold! Like a graveyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned to her. Far one moment control seemed shaken; his blood
      surged, his vision clouded; the sense that life and love were still within
      his reach filled him overwhelmingly. He turned towards Eve; he half
      extended his hands. Then, stirred by what impulse, moved by what instinct,
      it was impossible to say, he let them drop to his sides again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come! This is the way. Keep close to me. Put your hand
      on my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke quietly, but his eyes were resolutely averted from her face as
      they crossed the dim, silent court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the gloomy door-way that led to his own rooms, he felt her
      fingers tremble on his arm, then tighten in their pressure as the bare
      passage and cheerless stairs met her view; but he set his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he repeated, in the same strained voice. &ldquo;Come! It isn't far&mdash;three
      or four flights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a white face and a curious expression in her eyes, Eve moved forward.
      She had released Loder's arm as they crossed the hall; and now, reaching
      the stairs, she put out her hand gropingly and caught the banister. She
      had a pained, numb sense of submission&mdash;of suffering that had sunk to
      apathy. Moving forward without resistance, she began to mount the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ascent was made in silence. Loder went first, his shoulders braced,
      his head held erect; Eve, mechanically watchful of all his movements,
      followed a step or two behind. With weary monotony one flight of stairs
      succeeded another; each, to her unaccustomed eyes, seeming more colorless,
      more solitary, more desolate than the preceding one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last, with a sinking sense of apprehension, she realized that
      their goal was reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge broke sharply through her dulled senses; and, confronted by
      the closeness of her ordeal, she paused, her head lifted, her hand still
      nervously grasping the banister. Her lips parted as if in sudden demand
      for aid; but in the nervous expectation, the pained apprehension, of the
      moment no sound escaped them. Loder, resolutely crossing the landing, knew
      nothing of the silent appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second she stood hesitating; then her own weakness, her own
      shrinking dismay, were submerged in the interest of his movements. Slowly
      mounting the remaining steps, she followed him as if fascinated towards
      the door that showed dingily conspicuous in the light of an unshaded
      gas-jet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the moment that she reached his side he extended his hand
      towards the door. The action was decisive and hurried, as though he feared
      to trust himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space he fumbled with the lock. And Eve, standing close behind him,
      heard the handle creak and turn under his pressure. Then he shook the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, slowly, almost reluctantly, he turned round. &ldquo;I'm afraid things
      aren't quite quite right,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice. &ldquo;The door is locked
      and I can see no light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes quickly. &ldquo;But you have a key?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Haven't
      you got a key?&rdquo; It was obvious that, to both, the unexpected check to
      their designs was fraught with danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; He looked towards the door. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have a key.
      Yes, you're right!&rdquo; he added, quickly. &ldquo;I'll use it. Wait, while I go
      inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Filled with a new nervousness, oppressed by the loneliness, the silence
      about her, Eve drew back obediently. The sense of mystery conveyed by the
      closed door weighed upon her. Her susceptibilities were tensely alert as
      she watched Loder search for his key and insert it in the lock. With
      mingled dread and curiosity she saw the door yield, and gape open like a
      black gash in the dingy wall; and with a sudden sense of desertion she saw
      him pass through the aperture and heard him strike a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wait that followed seemed extraordinarily long. Listening intently,
      she heard him move softly from one room to the other. And at last, to her
      acutely nervous susceptibilities, it seemed that he paused in absolute
      silence. In the intensity of listening, she heard her own faint, irregular
      breathing, and the sound filled her with panic. The quiet, the solitude,
      the vague, instinctive apprehension, became suddenly unendurable. Then all
      at once the tension was relieved.. Loder reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a second in the shadowy door-way; then he turned unsteadily,
      drew the door to, and locked; it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve stepped forward. Her glimpse of him had been momentary&mdash;and she
      had not heard his voice&mdash;yet the consciousness of his bearing filled
      her with instinctive alarm. Abruptly, and without reason, their hands
      turned cold, her heart began to beat violently. &ldquo;John&mdash;&rdquo; she said
      below her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer, he moved towards her. His face was bereft of color; there was
      a look of consternation in his eyes. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come at once! I
      must take you home.&rdquo; He spoke in a shaken, uneven voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve, looking up at him, caught his hand. &ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo; she questioned. Her
      tone was low and scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, he drew her imperatively towards the stairs. &ldquo;Go very
      softly,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;No one must see you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the first moment she obeyed him instinctively; then, reaching the head
      of the stairs, she stopped. With one hand still clasping his, the other
      clinging nervously to the banister, she refused to descend. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she
      whispered, &ldquo;I'm not a child. What is it? What has happened? I must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Loder looked at her uncertainly; then, reading the expression
      in her eyes, he yielded to her demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's dead,&rdquo; he said, in a very low voice. &ldquo;Chilcote is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      To fully appreciate a great announcement we must have time at our
      disposal. At the moment of Loder's disclosure time was denied to Eve; for
      scarcely had the words left his lips before the thought that dominated him
      asserted its prior claim. Blind to the incredulity in her eyes, he drew
      her swiftly forward, and&mdash;half impelling, half supporting her&mdash;forced
      her to descend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in after-life could he obliterate the remembrance of that descent.
      Fear, such as he could never experience in his own concerns, possessed
      him. One desire overrode all others&mdash;the desire that Eve's
      reputation, which he himself had so nearly imperilled, should remain
      unimperilled. In the shadow of that urgent duty, the despair of the past
      hours, the appalling fact so lately realized, the future with its possible
      trials, became dark to his imagination. In his new victory over self, the
      question of her protection predominated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving under this compulsion, he guided her hastily and silently down the
      deserted stairs, drawing a breath of deep relief as, one after another,
      the landings were successively passed; and still actuated by the
      suppressed need of haste, he passed through the door-way that they had
      entered under such different conditions only a few minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      To leave the quiet court, to gain the Strand, to hail a belated hansom was
      the work of a moment. By an odd contrivance of circumstance, the luck that
      had attended every phase of his dual life was again exerted in his behalf.
      No one had noticed their entry into Clifford's Inn; no one was moved to
      curiosity by their exit. With an involuntary thrill of feeling he gave
      expression to his relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, it's over!&rdquo; he said, as a cab drew up. &ldquo;You don't know what
      the strain has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moving as if in a dream, Eve stepped into the cab. As yet the terrible
      denouement to their enterprise had made no clear impression upon her mind.
      For the moment all that she was conscious of, all that she instinctively
      acknowledged, was the fact that Loder was still beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In quiet obedience she took her place, drawing aside her skirts to make
      room for him; and in the same subdued manner, he stepped into the vehicle.
      Then, with the strange sensation of reliving their earlier drive, they
      were aware of the tightened rein and of the horse's first forward
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several seconds neither spoke. Eve, shutting out all other thoughts,
      sat close to Loder, clinging tenaciously to the momentary comforting sense
      of protection; Loder, striving to marshal his ideas, hesitated before the
      ordeal of speech. At last, realizing his responsibility, he turned to her
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice and with some hesitation, &ldquo;I want you to
      know that in all this&mdash;from the moment I saw him&mdash;from the
      moment I understood&mdash;I have had you in my thoughts&mdash;you and no
      one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize&mdash;?&rdquo; he began afresh. &ldquo;Do you know what this&mdash;this
      thing means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that after to-night there will be no such person in London as
      John Loder. To-morrow the man who was known by that name will be found in
      his rooms; his body will be removed, and at the post-modern examination it
      will be stated that he died of an overdose of morphia. His charwoman will
      identify him as a solitary man who lived respectably for years and then
      suddenly went down-hill with remarkable speed. It will be quite a common
      case. Nothing of interest will be found in his rooms; no relation will
      claim his body; after the usual time he will be given the usual burial of
      his class. These details are horrible; but there are times when we must
      look at the horrible side of life&mdash;because life is incomplete without
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These things I speak of are the things that will meet the casual eye; but
      in our sight they will have a very different meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; he said, more vehemently, &ldquo;a whole chapter in my life has been
      closed to-night, and my first instinct is to shut the book and throw it
      away. But I'm thinking of you. Remember, I'm thinking of you! Whatever the
      trial, whatever the difficulty, no harm shall come to you. You have my
      word for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll return with you now to Grosvenor Square; I'll remain there till a
      reasonable excuse can be given for Chilcote's going abroad; I will avoid
      Fraide, I will cut politics&mdash;whatever the cost; then, at the first
      reasonable moment, I will do what I would do now, to-night if it were
      possible. I'll go away, start afresh; do in another country what I have
      done in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence; then Eve turned to him. The apathy of a moment
      before had left her face. &ldquo;In another country?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;In another
      country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a fresh career in a fresh country. Something clean to offer you. I'm
      not too old to do what other men have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and for a moment Eve looked ahead at the gleaming chain of
      lamps; then, still very slowly, she brought her glance back again. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
       she said very slowly. &ldquo;You are not too old. But there are times when age&mdash;and
      things like age&mdash;are not the real consideration. It seems to me that
      your own inclination, your own individual sense of right and wrong, has
      nothing to do with the present moment. The question is whether you are
      justified in going away&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, her eyes fixed steadily upon
      his&mdash;&ldquo;whether you are free to go away, and make a new life&mdash;whether
      it is ever justifiable to follow a phantom light when&mdash;when there's a
      lantern waiting to be carried.&rdquo; Her breath caught; she drew away from him,
      frightened and elated by her own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loder turned to her sharply. &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; he exclaimed; then his tone changed.
      &ldquo;You don't know what you're saying,&rdquo; he added, quickly; &ldquo;you don't
      understand what you're saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve leaned forward again. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;I do understand.&rdquo; Her
      voice was controlled, her manner convinced. She was no longer the girl
      conquered by strength greater than her own: she was the woman strenuously
      demanding her right to individual happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand it all,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I understand every point. It was not
      Chance that made you change your identity, that made you care for me, that
      brought about&mdash;his death. I don't believe it was Chance; I believe it
      was something much higher. You are not meant to go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Loder watched her the remembrance of his first days as Chilcote rose
      again; the remembrance of how he had been dimly filled with the belief
      that below her self-possession lay a strength&mdash;a depth&mdash;uncommon
      in woman. As he studied her now, the instinctive belief flamed into
      conviction. &ldquo;Eve!&rdquo; he said involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick gesture she raised her head. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;No; don't
      say anything! You are going to see things as I see them&mdash;you must do
      so&mdash;you have no choice. No real man ever casts away the substance for
      the shadow!&rdquo; Her eyes shone&mdash;the color, the glow, the vitality,
      rushed back into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;I love you&mdash;and I need you&mdash;but there
      is something with a greater claim&mdash;a greater need than mine. Don't
      you know what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing; he made no gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the party&mdash;the country. You may put love aside, but duty is
      different. You have pledged yourself. You are not meant to draw back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loder's lips parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Don't say anything! I know all that is in your
      mind. But, when we sift things right through, it isn't my love&mdash;or
      our happiness&mdash;that's really in the balance. It is your future!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice thrilled. &ldquo;You are going to be a great man, and a great man is
      the property of his country. He has no right to individual action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Loder made an effort to speak, but again she checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Wait! You believe you have acted wrongly, and you
      are desperately afraid of acting wrongly again. But is it really truer,
      more loyal for us to work out a long probation in grooves that are already
      overfilled than to marry quietly abroad and fill the places that have need
      of us? That is the question I want you to answer. Is it really truer and
      nobler? Oh, I see the doubt that is in your mind! You think it finer to go
      away and make a new life than to live the life that is waiting you&mdash;because
      one is independent and the other means the use of another man's name and
      another man's money&mdash;that is the thought in your mind. But what is it
      that prompts that thought?&rdquo; Again her voice caught, but her eyes did not
      falter. &ldquo;I will tell you. It is not self-sacrifice&mdash;but pride!&rdquo; She
      said the word fearlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush crossed Loder's face. &ldquo;A man requires pride,&rdquo; he said in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at the right time. But is this the right time? Is it ever right to
      throw away the substance for the shadow? You say that I don't understand&mdash;don't
      realize. I realize more to-night than I have realized in all my life. I
      know that you have an opportunity that can never come again&mdash;and that
      it's terribly possible to let it slip&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Loder, his hands resting on the closed doors of the cab, sat
      very silent, with averted eyes and bent head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to-night,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you told me that everything was crying to
      you to take the easy, pleasant way. Then it was strong to turn aside; but
      now it is not strong. It is far nobler to fill an empty niche than to
      carve one for yourself. John&mdash;&rdquo; She suddenly leaned forward, laying
      her hands over his. &ldquo;Mr. Fraide told me to-night that in his new ministry
      my&mdash;my husband was to be Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words fell softly. So softly that to ears less comprehending than
      Loder's their significance might have been lost&mdash;as his rigid
      attitude and unresponsive manner might have conveyed lack of understanding
      to any eyes less observant than Eve's.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long space there was no word spoken. At last, with a very gentle
      pressure, her fingers tightened over his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John&mdash;&rdquo; she began, gently. But the word died away. She drew back
      into her seat, as the cab stopped before Chilcote's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously as they descended, the hall door was opened and a flood of
      warm light poured out reassuringly into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was your cab, sir,&rdquo; Crapham explained deferentially as they
      passed into the hall. &ldquo;Mr. Fraide has been waiting to see you this
      half-hour. I showed him into the study.&rdquo; He closed the door; softly and
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the warm light, amid the gravely dignified surroundings that had
      marked his first entry into this hazardous second existence, Eve turned to
      Loder for the verdict upon which the future hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she turned, his face was still hidden from her, and his attitude
      betrayed nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;you know why he is here.' You know that he has
      come to personally offer you this place; to personally receive your
      refusal&mdash;or consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased to speak; there was a moment of suspense; then Loder turned.
      His face was still pale and grave with the gravity of a man who has but
      recently been close to death, but beneath the gravity was another look&mdash;the
      old expression of strength and self-reliance, tempered, raised, and
      dignified by a new humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving forward, he held out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My consent or refusal,&rdquo; he said, very quietly, &ldquo;lies with&mdash;my wife.&rdquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
